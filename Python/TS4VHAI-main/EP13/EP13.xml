  <Text Key="126B4147">Last year, Christopher surprised me with a his-and-hers gaming setup for our house. I love gaming with him—though I am definitely mega-competitive.</Text>
  <Text Key="4EB7502F">Have you been to Gilbert Gardens yet? The gazebo is my favorite part; my spouse, Christopher, proposed to me right in front of it!</Text>
  <Text Key="27432D06">My son, Atlas, has been talking over and over about how he wants to learn how to ride a bike. I can't wait to teach him, but I can't help but remember some of the times I had trouble learning myself as a kid.</Text>
  <Text Key="C6F45383">Doli Ruano and I have been friends for a while. Just because she's mega-goth doesn't mean she's out of touch with fashion, and she's always the first one I go to for style tips.</Text>
  <Text Key="17BB1D0A">I used to live by myself in Anchorpoint Wharf for a while, but I have to be honest and say that I like it out here in Hopewell Hills. It's a nice, calm place to raise my kids.</Text>
  <Text Key="3057132D">It's pretty out here but I hear there used to be a lot more trees in the whole area. I guess when they were developing things, they cut down a lot of them. I'm a tech-y person so trust me, I love all the latest gadgets, but sometimes you do wonder what we're losing when we're racing forward all the time. </Text>
  <Text Key="5F302F69">This is way more gossip-y than I like to get, but did you know Xochitl Luna's husband died while cooking Gummy Bear Pancakes? Xochitl is just so nice; we've all felt just awful about it since it happened.</Text>
  <Text Key="29591597">It's not a secret, but I still prefer not to talk about it with people I don't know as well. I came out as trans just before we adopted Atlas. I'd been thinking about it for a long time but hadn't said anything to anyone until I blurted it out to my friend, Doli, and she just said: &lt;I&gt;if you feel like you are, maybe you should embrace the idea that you are a woman.&lt;/I&gt; I already knew in my heart who I really was, but that early support from her and from my husband meant everything.</Text>
  <Text Key="58BB339D">When Christopher and I got married, we went to Tartosa—I'm old acquaintances with Camille Soto, do you know her? Anyway, we had a galaxy-themed cake at our wedding because, well, I'm kind of into astronomy, if that wasn't obvious!</Text>
  <Text Key="CD8CE082">I started losing my teeth as a child before Atlas did; it's interesting to see how much that varies person-to-person. I was so excited to get that money from the tooth fairy, though! </Text>
  <Text Key="69700DD6">They added a little splashpad to the park not all that long ago. Believe it or not, the person we have to thank for that one is Ignacio Robles. He gets really involved in city business, and he kept saying there aren't enough things for kids with families to do around here, so he wanted that built up. It was so sweet of him. Atlas loves it there!</Text>
  <Text Key="2943E532">Atlas was such a quiet baby that I guess I expected Orion to be the same, but I guess things really do vary one child to the next. When Orion's awake, she's interested in everything and anything and does not want to sit still or be ignored. Keeping an eye on her is a full time job.</Text>
  <Text Key="13EFD01A">There are some really nice walking paths up in Gilbert Gardens; look for the signs and you'll be able to powerwalk around out there. Just keep an eye out for Whiteclaw the alligator!</Text>
  <Text Key="359EF6B7">Why do you think they call that neighborhood "Hopewell Hills" anyway? Sounds eerily upbeat. There's a really old tree stump out there—Ol' Stumpy. You should pay Stumpy a visit. </Text>
  <Text Key="FE96BF07">You know that clown painting over at the Recreation Center? Pretty sure it's haunted. No, not pretty sure. DEFINITELY sure!</Text>
  <Text Key="2C517963">That movie theater out on Anchorpoint Wharf has a massive selection. It seems like there's always a movie playing that'll suit your favorite genre!</Text>
  <Text Key="44F262D6">They keep the splash pad turned on even when it's cold or rainy, so maybe think twice before taking the kids there on a cold day.</Text>
  <Text Key="57610085">How many planets are in the universe? How many in ever, forever? Do you know the name of our planet? Also, do you know what a comet is?</Text>
  <Text Key="64F11932">I go to school with Karmine Luna. My mom wants me to be friends with her, but she likes really different stuff. She likes animals and making drawings and she thinks it's boring when I want to to play in the treehouse with her.</Text>
  <Text Key="A54467D4">You know how cool my dad is? He helped work on a super-cool treehouse with me! I love it when dad wants to spend time doing something special with me. </Text>
  <Text Key="CF7FBF9F">I'm working hard on not being bossy. Mom and dad say that's really important. But it bugs me when other kids don't listen to me.</Text>
  <Text Key="EF1CF16F">I know something sad about Karmine's dad, but I'm not supposed to talk about it. I never would, either. That'd be wrong.</Text>
  <Text Key="4051351B">When I'm all grown up I want to do something really cool like be an astronaut. My mom says I'm sorta destined for it, even. But she says to be an astronaut you have to be really good at science. Is that hard?</Text>
  <Text Key="75D1EA25">Mom is friends with that Doli lady, and sometimes Doli and Jay bring over their kid Tala. Tala is kind of a baby to me though. She cries a lot.</Text>
  <Text Key="BC0B389D">Orange and purple go together, right? Right? I'm trying to match my leggings with a new sweater, and I just can't make up my mind. I have to look amazing or I'll ruin my rep!</Text>
  <Text Key="3277B84B">I was at the movies with my friends a couple weeks ago watching The Great Pickle Capers—awesome film, by the way—and guess what happens out of absolutely nowhere? A frog shows up. Explain to me how there are frogs in a movie theater? So weird, dude.</Text>
  <Text Key="FFA16FEC">I bet I don't look too athletic to you, but I actually really love swimming. I prioritize music a bit, but I still like getting plenty of exercise.</Text>
  <Text Key="A4130770">Last week I completely bombed a test. Like, just absolutely got wrecked. I felt really embarrassed, but my grandpa made me breakfast for dinner and told me about this one time when he got in trouble for looking at a classmate's paper during an exam. </Text>
  <Text Key="93028F3E">Jay's really cool. They're a bit clumsy sometimes and a little silly, but I kind of like that contrast to my mom since she's always super-neat and organized. Those two have an interesting dynamic together. I can tell that they don't always get along as well as they pretend to, though.</Text>
  <Text Key="C0983A0A">My high school classmates talk about dating a lot, but I have to be real: I'm not that interested in dating. I like being around people, I care about folks a lot, but I don't always have really strong romantic feelings. Kinda ever. But I know that's not THAT unusual, and in my family we're raised to be proud of who we are. So I am! I'm proud of being not-super-into-romance!</Text>
  <Text Key="BEEE80D7">Sometimes I feel a lot of pressure to be good at stuff all the time. I got really burned out on violin, and I wonder if I'm disappointing my grandpa by not playing. Sometimes I worry I'm about to let my grades slip, too, and I can't afford that. I have too many things I want to do in my life and I can't afford to fail.</Text>
  <Text Key="2172D0C7">Don't tell anyone, but sometimes I sneak out at night to go swimming in the lake. Don't worry, it's safe out there and I always tell a friend where I am. But it's so peaceful being out there when the moon's shining on the water.</Text>
  <Text Key="FCD49DAA">Being a big brother is a huge deal to me, and I really want to be someone a little sibling can look up to. My mom's been worried that it might mean I try to take too many things on, but that's what siblings are for: being there for each other no matter what. </Text>
  <Text Key="29CC63BC">My dad's such a great writer. When I was little, we'd camp out in the backyard sometimes and when I was half-asleep in my sleeping bag, he'd come up with these super elaborate bedtime stories about this whole vampire family. Maybe not very kid appropriate, but I thought it was loads of fun.</Text>
  <Text Key="3B09094A">Everyone else in my family has an anchor tattoo to show that they're a Robles. My dad was so excited to join the family that he took my mom's last name, even! When I'm old enough, he and I are gonna go and get anchor tattoos together.</Text>
  <Text Key="911F7F59">My mom's friends with Xochitl Luna, and a few years ago she taught me an important lesson: if you're not coordinating your nails with your outfit, are you even living?</Text>
  <Text Key="B3CB6080">When I was pregnant with Aurelio, being good at fishing served me well; all I had to do was pop by the park and I could catch whatever I needed to have Ignacio whip up fish and chips for me that night. </Text>
  <Text Key="44EA9249">It gets pretty stormy here sometimes, but I always like to look on the bright side: more rain means better fishing for me!</Text>
  <Text Key="0970F6FE">I'm so proud of Aurelio, but I wish he'd ease up a little bit sometimes. He's always so worried about doing everything right and never making any mistakes, but he's a teenager: you're allowed to make some mistakes in order to grow.</Text>
  <Text Key="7103E77B">Xochitl and I went to school together and we've been friendly ever since. It's hard to imagine now, but did you know that she dated Christopher Michaelson once? Seems like it was a lifetime ago.</Text>
  <Text Key="ED44FAEB">Living this close to the park definitely has its advantages. Aurelio used to go to lock-in slumber parties at the Rec Center all the time, and I loved being able to take him for walks around the park when he was just a toddler. I wonder if I can get away with bringing the new baby out to fish at the lake with me?</Text>
  <Text Key="8FDD5B9E">Ian was let go from his job once, and it was a huge blow to his self-esteem. I wish he understood that sometimes your job just isn't a good fit and it doesn't make him a bad person, but I guess those value judgements are kinda built in for us sometimes, huh?</Text>
  <Text Key="1B19B687">Jay and I were so close when we were kids, and I don't really understand what happened. I think sometimes I'm a bit too hard on them. I offered some parenting advice once and, well, it went poorly. I know it's on me to fix things, but it's really hard to admit when you're wrong. I'll try harder.</Text>
  <Text Key="495F32A9">I hear Ignacio wants to raise money to get a karaoke machine at the Rec Center. More power to him, but something like that in the hands of a lot of people in our community seems a bit dangerous for the eardrums.</Text>
  <Text Key="FF61908B">I suppose at this point it's almost a cliche, but just because I'm pretty serious about my career in business doesn't mean I'm not capable of unwinding. I think it's important to look on the light side of things as much as you can.</Text>
  <Text Key="E60E8B5A">I didn't have a baby shower when I first had Aurelio, and I really feel like I missed out. It's nice to be the center of attention for a bit. </Text>
  <Text Key="A0521521">Dad and I tease one another sometimes about how different we can be in our family; he and Aurelio are both kind of clutterbugs, but I can't stand seeing anything out of place. I can't get comfortable in a messy house.</Text>
  <Text Key="833D92E4">You've talked to Xochitl before, right? I feel really protective of her, so I wanted to warn you about something: don't make any jokes about fire, okay? She's been through a lot and she deserves to be a bit more happy and carefree. Losing her husband was horrible.</Text>
  <Text Key="4AD63433">I went to go see "Greg's Revenge" with Xochitl and uh, let's just say: I do not ever, ever want to run into "Greg" in my lifetime. Nope! I'll keep enjoying my very normal, very werewolf-free life, please and thank you!</Text>
  <Text Key="63B334F9">I grew up over on San Myshuno and moved out here because this is where all new tech jobs are these days. I never expected to find myself living in the burbs, though.</Text>
  <Text Key="4978055E">When I thought about being a dad, I totally had visions of the elaborate treehouse I'd help my kids build someday. I want my kids to have a fun little escape, plus I want that dad-kid bonding experience of working together on a project!</Text>
  <Text Key="4DDA23C3">Sometimes, I just like to go for long walks around the lake over at Gilbert Gardens. It clears my head and helps relax me!</Text>
  <Text Key="17F37539">You know that little scar I have on my face? I got that a long time ago when I was learning to ride a bicycle back in the days when bikes were way less safe and helmets weren't the norm. You can bet my kiddos will be wearing a helmet when they're riding. </Text>
  <Text Key="A740B6C7">Deep, dark secret time: I am terrified of rabbits. It's silly, I know, but they just seem so dangerous somehow. You never know what a rabbit might do.</Text>
  <Text Key="02924474">We're going to wait until Orion's a toddler before we adopt another kid, but I'm definitely hoping to have lots and lots of kids. What's better than a house full of love?</Text>
  <Text Key="F1A4991C">I'm glad I live somewhere where it doesn't snow, but sometimes I get a little blue about the rain. My wife's all about stormy weather, though. I guess she has a flair for the dramatic.</Text>
  <Text Key="8E1F2B0C">The other day, somebody joked that I spoil Atlas too much. Truth be told, I am a little worried about over-indulging him, but it's hard not to see a kid that happy and want to spoil him rotten. </Text>
  <Text Key="2EAE5688">I'm not necessarily the most amazing painter in the world, but I do love art. Sometimes I stop by the Rec Center just to see what other folks are creating. It's pretty inspiring - just watch out for that creepy clown painting.</Text>
  <Text Key="26C970BA">Celeste has always said it's okay to talk about this stuff, but the day she came out to me to say that she was trans was so huge. I was surprised, but I also just thought that it somehow made so much sense for her. All I want is for my wife to be happy; it's really magical to see someone you love get to really, truly be themselves!</Text>
  <Text Key="D055F6D0">This guy, Kyle Kyleson, showed up on our doorstep a while back and he said we went to school together. Nice guy, though I swear I've never met him in my life. He made "chicken nuggies" for us and ever since then, Atlas has been begging to have him come back and stay again. </Text>
  <Text Key="05EE63AE">Bet it won't surprise you to hear that I have a rebellious streak. When I was a kid, I tried to break into that greenhouse in Gilbert Gardens. I was grounded for weeks.</Text>
  <Text Key="E1C43CFD">I'm definitely kind of a horror movie freak. I guess that's obvious with the whole goth aesthetic, right? I could see "Death Mirror" over and over and over and...</Text>
  <Text Key="8A2BB063">Jay's so adorable. I love it that they have their own sense of style, even if it's a bit...eclectic. Everyone should feel okay to choose their own path, yeah?</Text>
  <Text Key="C0F205E4">Jay read one - one - article about wolf eels recently and has gone completely off the rails about scary critters in the ocean and in lakes. Tell me they haven't said anything to you about lake monsters. You know there's no lake monster, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="C438ABA9">We took Tala to the splash pad in the park recently and she was absolutely loving it. Apparently the little whale there is called "Whalebert" or something like that. Now she wants to know when we're getting our own Whalebert. </Text>
  <Text Key="EB82538E">Our family does pretty well in terms of supporting ourselves, but I guess we're not as well-off as some folks. Can you imagine having the money to own a yacht? I feel like I'd rather spend the money on something more interesting or artistic, but to each their own.</Text>
  <Text Key="150F0646">One of my fashion advice posts went viral recently and yeesh. Talk about pressure. I don't know that I have enough energy to keep up with that lifestyle, though I admire those who can!</Text>
  <Text Key="8156FB14">My sister-in-law, Bernice, gave us a super-fancy dollhouse for Tala recently. There's been a bit of rift between her and Jay lately and I'm trying to stay out of it, but I wish they'd just talk things out. In my family, that's always how we handle things: we talk when we have problems and we work through them.</Text>
  <Text Key="A443B5FE">Ever since I met Jay when they were out swimming with their sister at the park, I've known we were meant to be together. I know it's corny but when you know, you know. </Text>
  <Text Key="588F45CC">You've met Ignacio, my father-in-law, right? He's always looking out for everyone. His wife passed away a long time ago, but he still hasn't gotten serious with anyone new. But it's never too late, right? Maybe he'll meet a new love!</Text>
  <Text Key="595E9FB8">It's interesting to hear Ignacio talk a lot about how much the area has changed over the years. They used to have trees so big they'd cut holes into them for you to ride your bike through, but now a lot of those trees are gone—down to just the stumps, even. Have you seen any of those stumps around?</Text>
  <Text Key="DA9C4F58">Celeste and I are best friends, but I'm also pretty friendly with Christopher. He's really started coming out of his shell since he got married and they had kids. He loves art, too, so we always have plenty to talk about.</Text>
  <Text Key="3F6B78E0">Do you think I can convince Xochitl to let me put a few gnomes out in the yard? I so want to have a nice little gnome collection.</Text>
  <Text Key="D11040C3">You know what I think? If you don't have a sense of humor about life, you're missing out.</Text>
  <Text Key="AB8A6552">I grew up here, you know. My family had a tiny little place out in Hopewell Hills back when it was just called "the hills." They went through a big effort to revitalize and rebrand it as a nice little suburban area. Which it was, but let's just say that the incomes of the people living there changed and now it's people who have a bit more money than my family had.</Text>
  <Text Key="C6C1BF5A">I love taking care of children. I think it's important to be a kind and nurturing presence in their lives, and I like to shake things up a little too. You know, give kids a piece of hard candy here and there or take them to the splash pad to play for hours!</Text>
  <Text Key="D1AD32B6">Kyle Kyleson came by and stayed with us a few weeks ago and I have to tell you a secret: while he was here, I pranked the toilet. You know what's funny? He seemed to be the kind of person who knows how to prank quite a few toilets himself, though he's actually more well-mannered than he looks like he is.</Text>
  <Text Key="46CEFDF7">I really love the way that Xochitl embraces her family and teaches Karmine to appreciate who she is without putting pressure on her. She's a really good mom, you know. </Text>
  <Text Key="E10A4241">I really hope I'm not adding pressure on Xochitl by being in the house. I just want to help, but I worry that she thinks I'm bothersome. I think we have everything worked out now, but I still try hard to watch out for her. Just because she's my daughter-in-law doesn't mean I love her any less than I loved my son.</Text>
  <Text Key="00C802DA">Karmine's had a loose tooth recently, so she's been learning all about the tooth fairy. I told her that she'll get a special surprise if she puts her tooth under the pillow after she loses it. Karmine thinks I was playing a joke on her, though!</Text>
  <Text Key="BCE23EA7">Ignacio Robles came by again to talk to me. He's a nice fellow, and he does a lot to help people. I'd like to take my time getting to know him, though.</Text>
  <Text Key="2C00C69B">I lost my son Colin recently but I lost my husband many years ago. It's been a long time, but I still keep my wedding ring on to remember him by. Also, I keep my wedding ring on because I'm not quite so sure I'm up to dating again. Maybe the right person will come along sometime, though.</Text>
  <Text Key="1CEF956A">I try hard not to look too much like a fussy old lady. I've met some fussy old ladies in my day, including one who hits people with a handbag. Can you imagine being that rude? </Text>
  <Text Key="E063B2F8">I've been wanting to travel over to Copperdale to see their ferris wheel. Karmine's afraid of heights, but I'm sure if she just saw how it looks out there, she'd want to try riding it right away!</Text>
  <Text Key="C3092E02">You'll never guess how I met my wife. I'm joking, I guess it's kind of obvious: we're both into fishing. Bernice is way better at it than I am, though. I don't know how she does it, but she almost never comes home empty handed. Sometimes I'm lucky just to catch a single minnow at the lake in Gilbert Gardens.</Text>
  <Text Key="494B605D">It's nice to see a new face around here. Do you have any hobbies? I like to keep busy!</Text>
  <Text Key="9182AC0E">My father-in-law's been trying to get better at Simbles, and he's been making me practice with him a bunch. I think I'm finally starting to get better at that game, though I wish sometimes he'd chill out and just work on a puzzle with me. I used to work on puzzles with my mom a lot.</Text>
  <Text Key="C9FD713D">I keep having this bizarre dream about something called a "Tooth Beary" coming to steal my teeth. Bernice tells me I'm being "eccentric" but those dreams are so vivid.</Text>
  <Text Key="FCA49DCA">Gilbert Gilberts apparently gifted the whole park area to the city in his will. If you ask me, that's the least he could do after building up all those factories only to let the fishing industry collapse when he felt like his investments were better spent elsewhere. Probably not something to be talking about with a new friend, though, huh. Maybe this is why people think I'm so weird.</Text>
  <Text Key="6E8F4AA2">Do you ever get really harebrained ideas that won't go away? I used to get this idea that I just couldn't live anymore if I didn't buy a bee box, but then it stopped outta nowhere. What's that about?</Text>
  <Text Key="17FF8CAD">I feel like this makes me a jerk, but I just don't get along well with one of my wife's friends. Xochitl isn't a bad person or anything, but we're a bit like oil and water. Anytime we talk, we're bound to disagree.</Text>
  <Text Key="2C7B2215">Being a writer is so stressful sometimes. Everyone thinks you're just full of great ideas, and sometimes you aren't. I got fired from a job once and I still feel like such a failure. I felt like I couldn't do anything right, you know? I hope that's not too much of a downer to share, but I really trust you.</Text>
  <Text Key="0CF0CF75">My favorite thing about Bernice is how supportive she is of me. She reads everything I write, even if it's just an instruction manual. I've been working on a novel, and she's been reading it as I go and always has thoughtful stuff to say about it. </Text>
  <Text Key="B1FFE725">When Aurelio was younger, he used to love dancing with me. I guess it's silly to ask a teenager to dance with his dad, but am I weird for kind of wishing we could just let loose and goof around like that again? Aurelio can be so serious sometimes unless he's talking to his grandpa.</Text>
  <Text Key="91528B91">My father-in-law knows a lot about the area, and I've kinda been wondering if I should work on a history of San Sequoia. But where to begin? There's a lot of history here that'd require some digging—and maybe even some uncomfortable truths.</Text>
  <Text Key="13D99114">It's actually a little hard for me to make friends, so I'm glad we're getting to know one another a bit better. I like having someone to talk to sometimes, even if I suppose I'm not always very interesting.</Text>
  <Text Key="F48008DB">I'm looking forward to getting to know you better. Everyone kind of jokes about it, but I try hard to get to know as many people in our community as we can. Community spirit is the glue that holds things together and keeps us all safe and happy.</Text>
  <Text Key="961513E5">Have you seen the fisherman statue in Hopewell Hills? That's my great grandpa, Bayani Robles. I have to laugh, they built up a little play area around him too with a pirate ship. I don't know what he would have thought about pirates, but I know his own boat was rather less fearsome-looking and a bit more on the run down side at first!</Text>
  <Text Key="EFDE6F67">I like to put a lot of energy into community work. I suppose I could put my time into other hobbies more often, but it matters to me to make this place a good place to raise a family. My great-great grandpa saw a lot of potential here when he first moved out to start a fishing trade, and I intend to keep that legacy going.</Text>
  <Text Key="7AF4BA4F">That son-in-law of mine is such a card. The other day I swear I saw him trying to read a book while doing pushups. Pick a lane, kid!</Text>
  <Text Key="3F6ECD41">Years ago, I gave my grandson, Aurelio, my wife's violin. I can tell he's outgrown it a little bit, but that's okay. I like to share family legacies, but I also want my family to develop their own personalities. I know his grandmother would love Aurelio's independent streak, too.</Text>
  <Text Key="F853A185">Some parents secretly have favorite kids. I know it, because I've seen it. But that's not my style. I love both of my children equally; they're amazing and unique folks and I wouldn't change a thing about them. Well, wait. I'd change one thing. I wish they got along better right now. But they will eventually, I'm sure of it.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F6F65FC">I know I seem chipper a lot of the time, but even I have had rough patches. Losing my wife was really, really hard. We were a team, and now I'm playing solo and I get lonely sometimes. I'm hoping that maybe I can find another person to be with, though I can't replace the love I've lost.</Text>
  <Text Key="DEF26BC1">I just love being a grandpa—a house full of children is a happy one for me. </Text>
  <Text Key="DCAA00D8">You should come by for dinner sometime! I love cooking, and it'd be a pleasure to whip up something gourmet and scrumptious for you. These days, my cooking's mainly pizza-focused. No, it's not my grandson demanding it- it's Ian who is all about that Canadian bacon pizza. </Text>
  <Text Key="1903E018">Anchorpoint Wharf is pretty different even from the way I remember it as a kid. It was all factories for a while, then it was a bit run-down and off-putting. They've put a lot of money into revitalizing it. That's for the best, I guess, but sometimes it feels a little too polished. I can't complain too much, though; after all, they put in that anchor sculpture to commemorate my family's contributions!</Text>
  <Text Key="32F2483A">I've been trying to stop by that Recreation Center a lot more lately since they spruced it up. There's a little game area now, and sometimes I go in to play some Simbles with folks. I'm actually not very good at Simbles, though I can play a mean game of chess.</Text>
  <Text Key="A77F55F2">As you know, the park is called Gilbert Gardens. The reason for that is pretty obvious if you've seen the old house within the park; way back when, that chunk of land was owned by a guy named Gilbert Gilberts. I kid you not! When he passed, he set up a trust to give the land to the city. I guess that's one way to apologize for cutting down half the sequoias in the area, eh?</Text>
  <Text Key="81F13266">I came out as nonbinary when I was in high school. My family was really chill about it. They/them feels right, though I am pretty fluid. My family all asked me what I'd prefer to be called in terms of name and so on; I said I'm fine with "sibling" or "brother" and "uncle" as well. That stuff's always a really personal decision and I appreciate my family asking first and respecting me without question. I know many nonbinary people really don't want any gendered stuff and I totally get it.</Text>
  <Text Key="13B91598">We're working hard on making Tala more independent. She gets a bit nervous when she can't be around us all the time, but as she grows up I know she'll be a lot more autonomous.</Text>
  <Text Key="9F4B8F8B">I remember the first time I made grilled cheese all by myself. Nearly started the kitchen on fire, but it kicked off my love affair with cooking. Of course, dad always helped inspire that, too.</Text>
  <Text Key="B156B90A">You ever just wake up in the morning and think "oh yeah, today's a great day to wear a raccoon costume?" Because I do, uh, every day.</Text>
  <Text Key="FC00F974">When I was a kid, my dad used to take me swimming at the lake over in Gilbert Gardens all the time. Then, one day, I felt something bite one of my toes. Fairly certain there's a lake monster. Or maybe a minnow did it. Or it's a lake monster. Yep! Lake monster. I'm sure if it.</Text>
  <Text Key="A2B2798F">Yet again, I've asked Doli if I can paint the living room with rainbow stripes. I do this every few weeks, cuz the answer might change. This time, Doli just laughed for a really long time and walked away. I guess some people don't want rainbow everything? She says it's fashion; I say it's boring. Oh no. Don't tell her I said that.</Text>
  <Text Key="3579F5EF">I'm lobbying really hard to take a family trip over to Henford-on-Bagley this year. You know what sold me? I heard that some of the foxes there like it when you sing to them.</Text>
  <Text Key="C69389E9">My dad'll tell you all about it, but we have a long family history here in San Sequoia. A long time ago, we first came here and got involved in the fishing trade, then opened up our own canning factory. Most of those factories are gone now. Can you believe they turned one factory building into a theater?</Text>
  <Text Key="9627E06E">My sister and I haven't gotten along as well lately and it's stressful. She kinda questions our parenting style sometimes. I get where she's coming from, but we're doing our best with Tala. Parenting is complicated!</Text>
  <Text Key="9F6A7457">My nephew Aurelio always calls me a "Disaster They." Can anyone explain what that is? I don't think I'm a disaster, but... </Text>
  <Text Key="A02A9D08">In my family, we have a tradition: we have anchor tattoos. Kinda funny since a lot of kids have parents who don't want them to get tattoos, but my dad was always excited about the day Bernice and I would be old enough to get our own tattoos. </Text>
  <Text Key="171F14ED">We're really into music in the Robles family. My wedding present from my dad was a piano that looks just like the one my parents had growing up. Pretty cool.</Text>
  <Text Key="36EA62C1">Have you ever seen a llama in person before? My mom says sometimes they spit. Do you know how to draw a llama? Can you teach me?</Text>
  <Text Key="B0E72369">My gramma Eleanor is so silly. The other day I was late to school because she pranked the toilet. My teacher didn't even believe me. She said grammas don't prank toilets. Yeah right!</Text>
  <Text Key="FE117226">My mom likes taking me to the Rec Center sometimes to play with other kids, but the music they have playing there is kind of annoying. Ugh.</Text>
  <Text Key="F19DA19D">If I can grow up to be anything I want, I want to be able to take care of animals. Or I want to be an artist. I bet I can do both if I try hard.</Text>
  <Text Key="BCB76D19">Last time we went to the movies as a family, there was this super tall person in front of my gramma. She got really annoyed, and mom kept telling her to be patient. We still got up and moved. I liked the movie.</Text>
  <Text Key="017DDD2B">Mom always tells me how proud she is that I am kind to other kids and that I have creative spirit. The truth is, sometimes I get really mad though and I don't want to be kind or nice. Sometimes I just wanna stomp and get mad! Is that okay?</Text>
  <Text Key="226A99DC">When I was littler, I thought the moon disappeared and had to make itself all over again every single night. Did you know that's where my name is from? The moon?</Text>
  <Text Key="A1AE0CDD">I dunno, man. It's just been a week y'know? Just...you ever see something you just can't un-see or get out of your head? Last week I set my LlamaBerry PowerSip on a bench while I was doing pushups at the park and a squirrel came by and like...knocked it over. Full can. Total waste. I'm clawing my way back to normalcy man, but it's a long road.</Text>
  <Text Key="6CE36094">You ever go drive up to Moonwood Mill? Bro, &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; guys know how to party. I was about 6 PowerSips deep and all of a sudden they start gettin' rowdy, screamin' and taking off their shirts. Was totally awesome. Me and my boy Josh used to go hard way back, but that was nuts. Maybe its something in the water over there.</Text>
  <Text Key="6FFA2544">People get so pressed about me doing pushups sometimes. They say things like "Why are you doing pushups right now" or "I'm calling the cops." Like just chill, doing pushups is like blinking for me, and we all gotta blink from time to time. Except for my boy Josh, yo he like never blinked. Was kinda creepy but also super rad. </Text>
  <Text Key="8DB1937E">Word of advice: don't do your dishes in that splash pad thing at the park. Went out there for a sort of Simstagram hashtag simple living moment, ended up with a bunch of dogs fighting with me for scraps while some scandalized moms glared at me. Extremely bad vibes.</Text>
  <Text Key="88A0538D">I got banned from the movie theater last week. I'm hoping they don't ban me for long but it was such a crummy deal. You talk once in a movie—that, by the way, I was all by myself at cuz I guess it was the last-ever showing of The Llama Hums at Midnight and I was talkin' through a scary part and next thing I know the usher's telling me I'm banned? </Text>
  <Text Key="759B4834">Alright, you keep asking me about that whole exploding toilet thing and I'm starting to feel guilty. Can I tell you the truth? I never made any toilet explode. Ever. It was just small misunderstanding with best boy Josh. But he thought it was the raddest thing ever, and went on to tell the rest of the boys. They loved it. I can never let them down. I will bear this shame. For the boys. </Text>
  <Text Key="361735B5">You ever have a rough day? I don't have many, but when I do, I like to unwind with a plate of chicken nuggies and a bit of zoning out in front of the TV. I could watch sitcoms for hours, man.</Text>
  <Text Key="9F52C198">Dude, I gotta say, you're like the REALEST person I know. If I had to choose you between you and my best boy Josh— Whoa that thought just made me SUPER SAD. I cant choose between bros. I love all my bros equally! Ah shoot I got some of that "feeling sweat" in my eyes again, BRO I need a tissue.</Text>
  <Text Key="115F5F96">You ever go to that Rec Center place? They built that up just recently I guess. Anyway, I see old people sometimes playing in there and I figured they were lonely so I sat down and played a game with them and it turns out I'm kind of a genius at that Simbles thing. </Text>
  <Text Key="7B5ECD4E">I don't think of myself as a couch surfer, I think of myself as a couch-trepreneur. Shocked? Listen, I have about a billion startup ideas, I just— bwahaha, no, no, man, I'm so sorry, I gotta stop there. Startup ideas. Me? Can you imagine? No way. For starters, do I look like a guy who wants to wear those weird puffy vests? Haha yeah right - unless?</Text>
  <Text Key="93B97884">I got this idea, right. You know how emojis kind of speak for themselves sometimes? Like instead of words? It's crazy right? What if we could somehow transfer that into like - real life, you know? I'm gonna do an "emoji face" right now, can you tell what I'm trying to say? — BRO no lie I think I'm onto something. I gotta write this down.</Text>
  <Text Key="B6857F3B">I had pretty big dreams for myself once upon a time. You know I was Prom King at Copperdale my senior year? For real! It went a little downhill after I sort-of-kind-of-accidentally made a school toilet blow up. Don't ask about the toilet thing. I mean it. DON'T ask about the toilet thing!</Text>
  <Text Key="60FF292C">Hey, did you see all those fancy painted utility boxes all around Anchorpoint Wharf? I guess they got tired of someone who definitely isn't me tagging them and decided to paint 'em officially. Pretty sweet, though.</Text>
  <Text Key="2A713784">The first time Karmine came to me to tell me that she had a loose tooth, she asked if she's supposed to wiggle it and I confess I got kinda grossed out by it when she tried. Whew. Sometimes you forget that being a mom involves some gross stuff. Like, you know, the time she peed on me when I was changing her...</Text>
  <Text Key="A71AC379">You know the tough thing about getting new tattoos? How itchy they are after. Everyone always asks if the ones I have hurt to get, and I just have to tell them that it's really more annoying to be that itchy without any way to scratch 'em.</Text>
  <Text Key="35C0B5DF">I have some equipment here at home, but I kinda like going to the Rec Center to work out. It's a nice chance to talk to folks and, well, hear all the local gossip. I fully admit to being a bit of a gossip hound.</Text>
  <Text Key="E8453E56">I planned a baby shower for Bernice, and her husband was so into helping out. Apparently, he found out about all these "mom" juice drinks we can make—you ever hear of a "mom-osa?"</Text>
  <Text Key="BBB87CC2">Elephant in the room: I know people talk, and yes- I did lose my husband a while back. Colin and I loved each other a lot, and I miss him every day. But he wouldn't want me to be sad about him all the time, so I focus on keeping my life in the present.</Text>
  <Text Key="AF731821">I am trying so hard not to get involved, but I can tell that Ignacio Robles is a bit interested in Eleanor. He should ask her out already! I bet she'd love to go on dates with him. The two of them are goofy enough to get along perfectly, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="CEF81F8D">I admit to not really liking Ian Robles all that much. He's talented, but he just has this habit of saying the absolute weirdest thing to you. As in, I agree that there are some really shady dealings that happened in this area a long time ago, way before the Robles family moved here even, but do you have to talk about that when we're having girl's night in?</Text>
  <Text Key="B75438AE">I'm an athlete, so people think I might be really vain. I can be, but our bodies are also just evidence that we're living beings. For example? I have tons of stretch marks from when I had Karmine. Some folks with those are proud of them or call them tiger stripes and things like that. I think that's cool, but for me, I just work towards being neutral about some parts of my body. I don't have to love everything, but I don't have to be embarrassed about it either.</Text>
  <Text Key="2EAF7E50">Karmine is going to be the most amazing artist, I can tell. She brings the most amazing drawings home from school, and she has an amazing imagination. I hope she holds onto that as she grows up.</Text>
  <Text Key="05A1B15E">Karmine's very first sleeping bag had llamas all over it. You should have seen how excited she was about it—she couldn't wait to start going to slumber parties!</Text>
  <Text Key="44444180">Seeing Celeste and Christopher happy together is so sweet. I've had breakups before that weren't always so smooth, but Christopher's just such a nice guy. Life's too short to hold a grudge for long, you know?</Text>
  <Text Key="C3154868">I try really hard to cultivate a chill and relaxed sort of home. At first, it was a big adjustment to have Eleanor move in after my husband Colin passed away, but we had a lot of good discussions about our boundaries and I think clearing the air helped. We both just want to make sure that Karmine has a normal childhood no matter what, and I like working together with Eleanor to achieve that.</Text>

  <Text Key="BD66B585">Is it wrong that {0.SimFirstName} told the lighting technician that there were free donuts in the backroom?

  <Text Key="F5D500C6">{1.SimFirstName} looks real mischievious, which is normally a good thing for a criminal, but {0.SimFirstName} told {1.SimFirstName}'s boss not to trust {1.SimPronounObjective}. {0.SimFirstName} gets a little joy from all the shifty looks that {1.SimFirstName} now gets.</Text>
  <Text Key="90A8AF0A">{0.SimFirstName} replaced {1.SimFirstName}'s briefcase full of Simoleans with... a cake. {1.SimFirstName} went to pick it up since it looked eerily realistic, like an actual briefcase. But alas, it was a cake. Nice going, cake hands!</Text>

  <Text Key="6B5D02F2">{0.SimFirstName} stole {1.SimFirstName}'s top secret file of potential thievery targets and burgled them {0.SimPronounReflexive} before {1.SimFirstName} could even plan a single heist! Sheesh...</Text>
  <Text Key="5B4CCE81">{0.SimFirstName} would never actually tip off the police. {0.SimPronounSubjective} might have let it leak that someone did though, which caused {1.SimFirstName} to have to start all over planning {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} big, upcoming heist. Better plan fast!</Text>
  <Text Key="9E4CEA10">{0.SimFirstName} heard a rumor about {1.SimFirstName}'s romantic interactions, and may have added fuel to the fire...</Text>

  <Text Key="01D54BD7">{0.SimFirstName} snuck over to {1.SimFirstName}'s desk early this morning and unplugged {1.SimFirstName}'s mouse. It's going to take {1.SimPronounObjective} a while to figure out why it isn't working and all the kids are going to find it hilarious! </Text>
  <Text Key="D8E71724">{0.SimFirstName} carved {1.SimFirstName}'s phone number onto the bathroom stall with the message "pls send freezer bunnies!!!" and listened with glee as {1.SimFirstName}'s phone beeped over and over all afternoon!</Text>
  <Text Key="B5E6933E">{0.SimFirstName} drew an outdated meme on the back of {1.SimFirstName}'s shirt in the morning, which made {1.SimFirstName} the laughing stock of the student body. Cringe!</Text>
  <Text Key="3C1C1955">{0.SimFirstName} is wondering if {0.SimPronounSubjective} chose the wrong career, finding grading quite... boring. {1.SimFirstName} on the other hand seems to love it, so {0.SimFirstName} slid some papers into {1.SimFirstName}'s grading pile.</Text>
  <Text Key="08D7E88B">Educators like apples, right? Well {0.SimFirstName} may have left a little present for {1.SimFirstName} on {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} desk. It was only a little mushy...</Text>
  <Text Key="EC472FC0">A local charity is placing a garden gnome in everyone's yard who donates a Simoleon to the cause. {0.SimFirstName} managed to rally everyone at work to pitch in for a donation.

  <Text Key="0F089FF5">{0.SimFirstName} will protest louder than {1.SimFirstName} and show everyone what is most important.</Text>
  <Text Key="2A1EBC25">Picking a cause is important, but {1.SimFirstName} seems to act like {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} cause is the best. {0.SimFirstName} will show {1.SimPronounObjective} by promoting {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} cause better.</Text>
  <Text Key="D1459021">{0.SimFirstName} made a public donation in {1.SimFirstname}'s name to the cause that's currently working against {1.SimPronounPossessiveIndependent}.

  <Text Key="66D03C37">{1.SimFirstName}'s drafting tablet ran out of battery, so {1.SimPronounSubjective} asked to borrow {0.SimFirstName}'s tablet. What an outrageous question... {0.SimFirstName} wouldn't have let {1.SimFirstName} borrow it even if they were on good terms.</Text>
  <Text Key="162FDB17">{1.SimFirstName} has been running behind on {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} next big project and needs some help before they pitch {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} plans to the client. {0.SimFirstName} offered to rundown the graphics for the client's business. Unfortunately, {0.SimFirstName} happened to grab a very outdated version off the internet instead. It's a simple "mistake" that will make {1.SimFirstName} look a little unprofessional. Oops.</Text>
  <Text Key="1FC4F720">{0.SimFirstName} has been working so hard to make {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} drafts perfect, and {1.SimFirstName} decided to put {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} coffee down on {0.SimFirstName}'s desk, leaving stains on the paperwork. {0.SimFirstName} can't believe the audacity, maybe {1.SimFirstName} deserves a few modifications to {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} drafts as well.</Text>
  <Text Key="962AA634">{1.SimFirstName} has been struggling to balance a high-profile client's needs and wants. Because the client is so high-profile, {1.SimFirstName}'s boss has been attentively watching how things progress. {0.SimFirstName} might have let slip some "obvious" solutions while at the water-cooler. Now, {0.SimFirstName} looks like a genius and {1.SimFirstName} looks like they couldn't do the job. </Text>
  <Text Key="59D46E89">{0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} both found themselves at the same neighborhood to interview homeowners, now the two of them have to race through the homes to get to the quota before the other.</Text>
  <Text Key="1E2FAF07">{1.SimFirstName} took a quick break while weight training, so {0.SimFirstName} put a few extra pounds on. Unfortunately {1.SimFirstName} was able to handle the added weight and it made {1.SimPronounObjective} look like a rockstar.</Text>
  <Text Key="DC41E7C3">As {1.SimFirstName} went in to take a shower at the end of the day, {0.SimFirstName} flushed the toilet a few extra times to turn up the heat on {1.SimFirstName}.</Text>
  <Text Key="638C6C07">{0.SimFirstName} swapped out {1.SimFirstName}'s workout outfit while they weren't looking with one that was five times too big! {1.SimFirstName} got reprimanded for looking sloppy, and had to work extra hard to keep their pants up all day. </Text>
  <Text Key="F5641244">When {1.SimFirstName} asked {0.SimFirstName} what time practice was, {0.SimFirstName} may have told {1.SimPronounObjective} the wrong time.

  <Text Key="0EDD87D8">{0.SimFirstName} made sure to put {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} heel out so that {1.SimFirstName} would clip it and fall. It all went to perfect plan and now {1.SimFirstName} has a few fun videos floating around simstagram of {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} gracefulness.</Text>
  <Text Key="F98B58A0">Maybe {0.SimPronounSubjective} got lucky today, but when {1.SimFirstName} wasn't looking, {0.SimFirstName} closed out {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} program before {1.SimPronounSubjective} could save their work. Always remember to save!</Text>
  <Text Key="A3896C70">{0.SimFirstName} submitted an anonymous review to the local papers completely lambasting {1.SimFirstName} and {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} recent work, calling it "pedestrian" and saying their writing "lacked any innovation" at all. That's gotta sting!</Text>
  <Text Key="5FAB3BD8">Writing is all subjective, or at least that's what {1.SimFirstName} said, and {0.SimFirstName} couldn't agree less! So {0.SimFirstName} went in and made a few edits to {1.SimFirstName}'s latest piece.</Text>
  <Text Key="DFC91754">{0.SimFirstName} received word that a certain publisher was looking at {1.SimFirstName}'s newest work, but they needed an immediate turnaround on edits to make the call. Too bad {0.SimFirstName} made sure {1.SimFirstName}'s name was top of the list to help volunteer at the local high school writer's camp. Sure, {1.SimFirstName} looks good for a little philanthropy. But they aren't going to get their work published anytime soon, are they? </Text>
  <Text Key="D1691917">{1.SimFirstName} was complaining about their current editor, so {0.SimFirstName} jumped in to say {0.SimPronounSubjective} would help out. Too bad for {1.SimFirstName} as {1.SimPronounSubjective} will soon find out how nitpicky {0.SimFirstName} is when {1.SimFirstName}'s paper is covered in red.</Text>
  <Text Key="B7E453EB">{1.SimFirstName} is quite pompous when it comes to others, so {0.SimFirstName} decided to share {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} real thoughts on {1.SimFirstName}. Too bad the boss was listening and reprimanded {0.SimFirstName} for not being a team player.</Text>
  <Text Key="BDB096A0">{0.SimFirstName} was asked who {0.SimPronounSubjective} wanted to work with today, and {0.SimPronounSubjective} chose {1.SimFirstName}. Then {0.SimFirstName} made {1.SimFirstName} do all the hard work and gave {0.SimPronounReflexive} the easy work so {0.SimPronounSubjective} could leave {1.SimFirstName} working alone all night.</Text>
  <Text Key="AC85B0DA">In casual conversation, {0.SimFirstName}'s boss asked about {1.SimFirstName}'s work performance. Well, {0.SimFirstName} was brutally honest, to the point where it cost {1.SimFirstName} a promotion. Better luck next time!</Text>
  <Text Key="BF70D99C">{0.SimFirstName} made a rumor that layoffs were coming, and lead {1.SimFirstName} to believe {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} name was on the list. At first it was funny, but then {0.SimFirstName} started to feel bad for all of {1.SimFirstName}'s worrying.</Text>
  <Text Key="93B68E47">{0.SimFirstName} made sure to get into work early, knowing {1.SimFirstName} would try to be even earlier tomorrow, wasting {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} time with little benefit.</Text>
  <Text Key="3B5C436D">{1.SimFirstName} complained about the little zap {1.SimPronounSubjective} got from {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} robotics table, so {0.SimFirstName} may have given {1.SimFirstName} another little zap to scare {1.SimPronounObjective}. {0.SimsFirstName} almost felt bad seeing the dazed look on {1.SimFirstName}'s face.</Text>
  <Text Key="38F21AEB">{0.SimFirstName} hid a few tools from {1.SimFirstName}'s bench to make {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} progress a little harder.

  <Text Key="D8332DAF">{1.SimFirstName} seems to think that the robots are going to rise up against the world. {0.SimFirstName} has assured {1.SimPronounObjective} that isn't possible, but {0.SimFirstName} may have made a few changes to {1.SimFirstName}'s robot to make {1.SimPronounObjective} think otherwise.</Text>
  <Text Key="B16D0589">{1.SimFirstName}'s little Chatter Bot was driving everyone in the workroom crazy so {0.SimFirstName} made a few "modifications" and now {1.SimFirstName} has some extra robot salvage parts to work with.</Text>
  <Text Key="148AB559">{0.SimFirstName} said that the Golden Chatter Bot was obviously the best color, but {1.SimFirstName} just couldn't agree with {0.SimPronounObjective} and said it was the Red Chatter Bot. {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} have disagreed in the past but this is really the last straw.</Text>
  <Text Key="901A6309">{0.SimFirstName} offered to mail some of {1.SimFirstName}'s documents for them. Unfortunately...{1.SimFirstName} hadn't put the stamps on the envelopes yet. Hopefully, {1.SimFirstName}'s clients won't find silly llama postage stickers too unprofessional!</Text>
  <Text Key="2B137E6A">{0.SimFirstName} got stuck with a case that nobody wanted, so {0.SimPronounSubjective} tried to swap it with one of the other cases that {1.SimFirstName} had, unfortunately {1.SimFirstName} noted and reported {0.SimFirstName} to the boss so now {0.SimPronounSubjective} will probably get all the boring cases until everyone forgets what {0.SimPronounSubjective} did.</Text>
  <Text Key="A24F2CD7">{1.SimFirstName} got the case {0.SimFirstName} wanted so {0.SimPronounSubjective} may have swapped a few folders so that {0.SimPronounSubjective} could start working on the case and get to take over.</Text>
  <Text Key="1694737B">{1.SimFirstName} kept bragging about how fast {1.SimPronounSubjective} file paperwork, so {0.SimFirstName} added a few extra case files to {1.SimFirstName}'s pile. Now who is faster?</Text>
  <Text Key="F201F4DD">{0.SimFirstName} messed with the settings on {1.SimFirstName}'s Research machine in hopes it might make {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} work take a little longer.

  <Text Key="7BA34F19">{1.SimFirstName} asked is {0.SimFirstName} had a blue or black pen, to which {0.SimFirstName} replied "No". Of course that wasn't the whole truth as {0.SimFirstName} was the one who hid all of the pens, so {1.SimFirstName} wouldn't have anything to work with.</Text>
  <Text Key="46A8F876">{1.SimFirstName}'s top was missing something so {0.SimFirstName} helped by accidentally spilling some coffee on {1.SimPronounObjective}.

  <Text Key="EA76564F">Sequoia Cottage</Text>
  <Text Key="6C2654AE">This modern addition to the neighborhood has a lot of curb appeal and plenty to love on the inside, too. Nested within the suburban, tree-filled neighborhood that was developed originally by Gilbert Gilberts, 36 Bayani Place has Dream home written all over it. The street name itself is an homage to Bayani Robles, whose statue is located within the adjacent park.</Text>
  <Text Key="BE8E4025">36 Bayani Place</Text>

  <Text Key="6A47B0AF">Parkside Place</Text>
  <Text Key="48FF7035">This plot of land is right at the center of all of Anchorpoint Wharf's action. It is perfectly poised location between the duality of the area: the calm, serenity of a lovely ocean view and the bustle of its historic downtown area. Best of all, the library is right across the way, so whoever lives here can stop by and pick up a good book anytime.</Text>

  <Text Key="6A0CD6E1">Anchorpoint Library</Text>
  <Text Key="862C4EC5">When Bayani Robles first purchased this plot of land and began building Robles Point, he surely never envisioned the legacy his family has gone on to have! This house has had many changes and additions over the year, but it all adds to the home's character and shows that Anchorpoint Wharf is an ever-evolving area where the old and the new come together.</Text>

  <Text Key="BF6F14B2">Celeste and Christopher met working at the same startup. They couldn't believe how much they had in common when they first went out for coffee together! After they got married, they adopted Atlas and promptly began spoiling him rotten. Now they've also adopted Orion and are hard at work raising two kids to be just as nerdy as they are.</Text>
  <Text Key="45F8114D">Michaelson</Text>
  <Text Key="B3656710">The Robles family is pretty entrenched in this community—they've been here ever since the fishing trade started taking off, and for years had a thriving family business. Ignacio's the patriarch of this family, but just because they have deep roots doesn't make them all that conventional. They know everyone and anyone, and love being a part of everything this community has to offer—from spending way too much of their free time down by the waterfront to organizing big family gatherings at Gilbert Gardens park.</Text>
  <Text Key="4D29003F">Robles</Text>
  <Text Key="318BE06A">The Robles-Ruano Family is a bit on the unconventional side, but being conventional is soooo boring, right? These folks are all about expressing themselves and their personality no matter what. Both parents are hoping that their unique ways will rub off on their slightly clingy daughter, Tala. With a little love, Tala is sure to grow into a confident (and creative!) kid.</Text>

And it's certainly looking that way between {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName}!\n\nFamily members with the &lt;b&gt;Difficult&lt;/b&gt; family dynamic will be Mean to each other more often, the younger Sim will be less likely to follow the rules or demands of the older Sim, and the younger Sim will Complain to the older Sim more often.\n\nWould you say that &lt;b&gt;{0.SimFirstName}&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;{1.SimFirstName}&lt;/b&gt; have a &lt;b&gt;Difficult&lt;/b&gt; family dynamic?</Text>

  <Text Key="8CC239EB">Back Carriers are the perfect accessory for on-the-go families with Infants. It frees up the hands of Teen and older Sims to do a variety of activities, including holding another Infant or Toddler!\n\nYou can choose from a variety of colors by selecting &lt;b&gt;Set Preferred Back Carrier&lt;/b&gt; on an Infant, in the &lt;b&gt;Baby Care&lt;/b&gt; category of the interaction pie menu. </Text>

  <Text Key="1E52E499">Sims with Neutral Confidence are still figuring out how they feel about their own capabilities. They can be easily encouraged or discouraged when gaining or losing confidence. A Sim with Neutral Confidence will have neither High nor Low Self-Esteem when aging into a teen.</Text>
  <Text Key="65E61BD5">All Children Sims have a Confidence Level. Confidence begins in a Neutral state but may become High or Low throughout a Sim's childhood. Having High or Low Confidence will impact a Child's mood, and the effects may have a long-term affect on Self-Esteem throughout their lives.\n\nA child Sim's confidence level can increase or decrease depending on skill gain, school performance, positive and negative socialization, succeeding or failing in skill-based activities, confident or embarrassed moods, and more. Caregivers criticizing or praising a child's behavior also impacts their confidence levels.\n\nA Child's current Confidence Level is visible as a Temporary Trait in the Simology Panel.</Text>
  <Text Key="FB33DAE2">Sims with Low Confidence are at higher risk of receiving a Fear of Being Inferior, they get stressed when losing confidence, and they become embarrassed when a caregiver criticizes them. Support means everything to these Sims. If not addressed, Low Confidence becomes Low Self-Esteem when aging into a teen.</Text>
  <Text Key="CC4AF03A">Sims with High Confidence have learned to believe in themselves. They become confident more easily, even when learning from mistakes. However, they can still be hurt when criticized. High Confidence becomes High Self-Esteem when aging into a teen.</Text>

  <Text Key="8A0F84A4">Conversation Topic preferences can be selected from the &lt;b&gt;Likes and Dislikes&lt;/b&gt; section in CAS. Liking a Conversation Topic indicates that &lt;b&gt;your Sim enjoys having other Sims interact with them in that way&lt;/b&gt;. Disliking a Conversation Topic means &lt;b&gt;your Sim will likely reject that type of interaction when another Sim performs it&lt;/b&gt;. For example, if your Sim &lt;b&gt;Dislikes Gossip&lt;/b&gt;, they will most likely respond negatively when another Sim tries to Gossip with them. But that won't stop them from being able to perform Gossip interactions towards another Sim.</Text>
  <Text Key="DB67C90E">Note that each Conversation Topic corresponds to a different subcategory of interactions available in the &lt;b&gt;Pie Menu&lt;/b&gt; when interacting with other Sims. Upon learning another Sim's Conversation Topic preferences, you can easily find the types of interactions they enjoy hearing (and avoid the ones they don't!)</Text>

  <Text Key="94A80141">Family Dynamics between two Sims in a household can be set in &lt;b&gt;Create A Sim&lt;/b&gt; under the &lt;b&gt;Household Relationships&lt;/b&gt; panel. They can also be discovered naturally in &lt;b&gt;Live Mode&lt;/b&gt; based on experiences those Sims have together.\n\nTo remove an existing Family Dynamic between your Sim and a family member, your Sim can purchase the &lt;i&gt;Dynamic-No-More Potion&lt;/i&gt; from the &lt;b&gt;Rewards Store&lt;/b&gt;. Sims might also discover that their dynamic has changed in &lt;b&gt;Live Mode&lt;/b&gt; based on how their relationship develops with their family members!</Text>
  <Text Key="38F4A0B3">The Keepsake Box is not only a great place to keep your family mementos, but can also be used to change the Family Dynamic between two Sims. \n\nThis item can be found in &lt;b&gt;Build Mode&lt;/b&gt;, and must be designated as the family keepsake by an Elder Sim to be used. Once that’s completed, Sims can &lt;b&gt;Ponder the Meaning of Family&lt;/b&gt;. \n</Text>
  <Text Key="4484A464">Family Dynamics define the relationship between two family members, revealing how they'll feel and act when around each other. Different familial relationships allow for different types of dynamics to be set. Once two Sims have a dynamic, you'll notice them receiving unique buffs when spending time together, and autonomously choosing interactions that suit the nature of their dynamic.</Text>

  <Text Key="284C8624">Infants and Toddlers are unique! In addition to traits, each Infant and Toddler starts off with a total of three hidden Quirks. These Quirks affect how the Sim will behave during their current age and will be discovered automatically when the affected behavior occurs. Visit the Trait Section of the Simology panel to review these Quirks after they've been discovered.</Text>

  <Text Key="3866D0FC">Caregivers can now change diapers for Infant and Toddler Sims by using the Changing Table! Different Changing Tables can be purchased directly from Build Buy mode with or without a Diaper Pail attached. If an Infant Sim is left with a dirty diaper for too long they can get a diaper rash. </Text>
  <Text Key="AE2F5082">Infants can learn through play by interacting with the Playmat. Caregivers can bond with an Infant by playing or socializing with an Infant Sim on the Playmat. As your Infant progress towards milestones, they will eventually be able to play alone and show off new surprising behaviors. Try running Tummy Time Together to help your Infant Sim unlock milestones faster!  </Text>
  <Text Key="765AF79F">Infant Care Objects</Text>
  <Text Key="6777E855">Infant Milestones are celebrated moments where Infant Sims experience life and develop capabilities as they learn and grow. Some Infant Milestones come from natural development or socialization, while others can be progressed through Milestone-specific interactions. Like regular Milestones, Infant Milestones are about the journey of raising an Infant.\n\nInfants can achieve Firsts, Life, Social, Gross Motor, and Fine Motor Milestones.</Text>
  <Text Key="E2D3BA67">While all Sims can achieve Social Milestones, Infant Social Milestones help them develop emotionally and verbally. These Milestones will allow them to better express themselves and build relationships with other Sims. The more Social Milestones they unlock as an Infant, the more advanced their Toddler Communication skill becomes.\n\nHave other Sims run &lt;font color="#199C2C"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friendly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; interactions with the Infant to get started! As they progress, Infants can start to verbally respond to other Sims, toys, stuffed animals, and even when trying new food.</Text>
  <Text Key="2531CC03">Achieving Gross Motor Milestones allow Infants to develop the muscles in their body for whole body movement and coordination. The more Gross Motor Milestones they unlock as an Infant, the more advanced their Toddler Movement skill becomes.\n\nTo start, all Infants depend on other Sims for mobility, so progressing through these Milestones will affect how your Infant can get around by themselves. Once they learn to Sit Up, they can scoot around nearby. After learning how to crawl, your Infant will get a taste of independence and excitement for what the world has to offer!\n\nHave a caregiver practice &lt;b&gt;Tummy Time Together&lt;/b&gt; found in the &lt;font color="#199C2C"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; category under &lt;font color="#199C2C"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friendly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; interactions to start with the basics. As they achieve more Milestones, they will unlock more interactions targeted to practicing and strengthening their muscles!</Text>
  <Text Key="B634B83C">Achieving Fine Motor Milestones allow Infants to strengthen smaller muscles for more controlled and precise movements in their hands. These Milestones affect how they interact with toys and food in the High-Chair. The more Fine Motor Milestones they unlock as an Infant, the more advanced their Toddler Thinking skill becomes.\n\nUsing the &lt;font color="#199C2C"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Way-to-Play Playmat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is a great way to start building up those tiny muscles. After learning the basics, playing with toybox toys, nesting blocks, and dollhouses will help further them along.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F792A4D">As you progress through Infant Milestones, you will unlock new behaviors and interactions for Infants and Caregivers. For example, as Infants progress in their Gross Motor milestones they'll gain the Fun Need, which opens up new possibilities with various play objects to keep your Infant happy.\n\nIf you can achieve the more advanced Infant Milestones, your Infant can get a head start on their Toddler skills when they age up.</Text>

  <Text Key="5E494321">Once a Midlife Crisis has started Sims will have various desires to fulfill, which can be found in the Aspirations panel. Desires are optional, but completion of desires will help decrease the duration of the crisis. Once a desire has been completed it is replaced with a new desire. After a number of desires have been completed the Sim's Midlife Crisis will end.</Text>
  <Text Key="B30985A2">Adult sims might get a midlife crisis that will last for a period of time and will have an impact on what the Sim wants to do. This will manifest in a variety of four different types of Midlife Crisis. </Text>
  <Text Key="44F2FBDD">Midlife Crisis</Text>
  <Text Key="93566685">Depending on where your Sim is in life, Revealable Milestones may show up in the Simology Panel to give you clues on how to achieve them.\n\nFrom learning fundamentals as an Infant to retiring from their career as an Elder, Sims reach Milestones throughout their lives. Have your Sim experience new things and see what you can achieve!</Text>
  <Text Key="E2970FFF">All Sims can achieve Firsts, Life, and Social Milestones, while Toddlers and Infants have additional categories related to learning and development. \n\nThe Simology Panel will show recently completed Milestones for your Sim's current age. When a Sim completes a Milestone, it will appear under the appropriate category. Hovering over the Icon will tell you information about the Milestone. Clicking &lt;font color="#199C2C"&gt;&lt;b&gt;View Milestones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; will show completed Milestones throughout all of your Sim's life.</Text>
  <Text Key="D5735143">Milestones track key moments in your Sim's life, allowing you to reminisce on their journey. Think of Milestones as a collection of experiences rather than an achievement list. Your Sim isn't required to complete them all.\n\nAchieving certain Milestones can affect your Sim's behavior and mood, reward special memorabilia, and unlock new interactions.</Text>
  <Text Key="D6FCBEEF">Milestones</Text>
  <Text Key="B8C15E7E">Self Discovery trait moments will appear based on the activities and recent life experiences of the Sim. These moments are completely optional, and can be embraced or declined. Self Discovery moments can be turned off for all Sims in the Game Options panel.</Text>
  <Text Key="30A4BCA7">Young Adults through Elders can have a moment of Self Discovery where they may find a new trait that is suitable for them. In these Self Discovery moments Sims will be presented with a new Personality Trait or potentially recommended a Personality Trait to swap with an existing one if the two traits conflict. Through Self Discovery Sims will be able to embrace up to 3 Discovery Moments.</Text>
  <Text Key="2423A4B6">Self Discovery</Text>
  <Text Key="471A551A">When meeting other Sims, the Sim Characteristic Likes and Dislikes your Sim has selected will be compiled into a &lt;b&gt;Social Compatibility&lt;/b&gt; that falls into one of five levels: Awful, Bad, Neutral, Good, or Amazing Compatibility. This compatibility score takes the Sim Characteristic Likes and Dislikes of both Sims into account!\n\nWhen your Sim has compatibilities that aren't Neutral, you can see them for each Sim in the &lt;b&gt;Relationships&lt;/b&gt; panel in &lt;b&gt;Live Mode&lt;/b&gt;. Sims with better compatibility will find it much easier to become friends, while worse compatibility will present a considerable challenge for developing that relationship.</Text>
  <Text Key="AE40F428">Sim Characteristic preferences can be selected from the &lt;b&gt;Likes and Dislikes&lt;/b&gt; section in CAS. Each type corresponds to a category other Sims might fall into based on their traits, Likes and Dislikes for Activities, and other aspects of their personality they might have gained during their life.\n\nFor example, the Homebody category includes Sims with traits like &lt;b&gt;Loner&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Bookworm&lt;/b&gt;, but also Sims that &lt;b&gt;Like Writing&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Like Cooking&lt;/b&gt;. Liking and Disliking a wide range of different Sim Characteristics will lead to more variation in compatibility with other Sims!</Text>
  <Text Key="F62A0276">Sim Characteristic Preferences</Text>
  <Text Key="43988AE9">Puzzles can be selected from a number of categories and can vary in difficulty, depending on the size of the puzzle selected. Nearby Sims are able to join in the fun, or sit and socialize as well. Completed Puzzles can even be framed as wall art!\n\nThere is also a &lt;b&gt;Custom Puzzle by Reference&lt;/b&gt; option that allows Sims to take a capture of something nearby, and then put together a puzzle of that image! </Text>
  <Text Key="7DE32642">The Celebration Center in Gilbert Gardens hosts a variety of new social activities for Sims to engage in!\n\nOn the game tables there, you'll find a new tile game called Simbles, as well as Puzzles. These can also be found on game tables purchased in &lt;b&gt;Build Mode&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nSeveral walking paths are available across the park that friends and families can walk on together, taking in the views of the park. </Text>
  <Text Key="2FB1E956">There are 3 paths in Gilbert Gardens that Sims can walk together on or by themselves. These can be started via the signs marking the head of the trail. \n\nUse Jog and Powerwalk options for a little exercise and fitness, or take a reflective walk for something more casual. </Text>

  <Text Key="26A949B0">A planned or currently running Stay Over can be cancelled at any time via the &lt;b&gt;Calendar&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="E7127EC2">Stay Overs can be initiated from the Calendar, Phone, or Relationship Panel. It's a good idea to double check the guest list and duration prior to confirming your plans. There might also be times when another Sim outside of your Sim's household calls to arrange a Stay Over!\n\nDuring the Stay Over, guests can be asked to help around the house, or simply relax during their stay. The choice is yours!</Text>
  <Text Key="205F3B4D">Stay Overs are a new type of event that involve family or friends sleeping over at your Sim's house for a set period of time. Since these can last multiple days, it's a good idea to make sure visiting Sims have a place to sleep!\n\nOnly one Stay Over can be active for a household at any time. Other events, such as birthday parties or weddings, can be held during a Stay Over! Planning a Stay Over is a great way to tell stories involving guests arriving a few days early for a big event.</Text>

  <Text Key="09970C7D">Sims can now build the treehouse of their dreams! To get started, your Sim can purchase a treehouse base in &lt;b&gt;Build Mode&lt;/b&gt; like the &lt;i&gt;Timber! Treehouse Base&lt;/i&gt;. Upon purchasing the base, any Sim aged Teen or older can begin building the treehouse. Once building starts, any Sim from Child age and older can join in to help.\n\nAfter the treehouse is fully built, Sims with enough Handiness Skill can upgrade it with fun additions like a slide or bell. Child Sims can also redecorate the treehouse to match their interests.</Text>
  <Text Key="86191EBC">Objects that are able to be placed on the balcony of a built treehouse can be found by searching for &lt;b&gt;Placeable on Treehouse&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;Build Mode&lt;/b&gt; catalog. These objects include children's toys, some instruments, activity tables, and more! Due to space constraints, certain objects will only fit onto certain parts of the treehouse balcony.</Text>
