  <Text Key="4F663AC0">Oh, everyone knows that it's customary around Finchwick to give a Finchwick Favor of cheese to the grocer. It's just a bit odd when they order the cheese from us only to give it back! Oh well, customs are customs, I suppose.</Text>
  <Text Key="351A9C8D">I know someone who orders ten milks a week. At that point, I'd just purchase my own cow!</Text>
  <Text Key="70EE9267">I've got one customer who always swears there are mushrooms in the Bramblewood that only show up at night. Sounds strange to me.</Text>
  <Text Key="88997EA4">Well, it's tradition to give the Grocery Delivery person Yorkshire Pudding around here. And no - I'm not making up that part about 'tradition' so that I'll get more free pudding. Preposterous.</Text>
  <Text Key="CA8B421C">The Crumplebottoms are always ordering crumpets. I wonder if that's where their name originated from?</Text>
  <Text Key="EC803625">Want to hear a ghost story? Have you heard of Lord Volpe, founder of Finchwick? Well, his first wife was Lady Volpe, a beauty who many thought a witch from the Bramblewood. Some say she spoke with foxes, others that she controlled the snails. What we know for certain is that she drowned in the River Bagley. If you go swimming in it nowadays without leaving a present for Sophie, she might pull you down. So best leave a little gift under Sophie the Snail lest you feel a tickle on your feet in the river, I say.</Text>
  <Text Key="8D843042">Do you know the mill in Old New Henford? Many years ago, there was an accident - that poor Algernon Watson - and they shut it down to make sure everything was safe before letting anyone back in. But the strangest thing! That very night, the mill started turning again, all on its own. They went by the next morning and the door was locked from the inside! They've never shut the mill down since. I'd reckon they're afraid to now.</Text>
  <Text Key="FDE2F6C0">When I took on the Pub, everyone started bringing me Cottage Pie. Apparently, it's the traditional Henford-on-Bagley Finchwick Favor. Not that I mind. Cottage Pie is delicious!</Text>
  <Text Key="0E39F5D3">Are you looking to get spooked? Well, it's rumored that a pure obsidian egg can birth the incarnation of evil in its &lt;i&gt;purest&lt;/i&gt; form. In time, a small, seemingly innocent chick will spring forth. But beware! For it is bathed in flames of terror and its destiny is one of fire. They say these very chickens conspire with the Grim Reaper. That's the rumor anyways. Probably just a tale to scare the children.</Text>
  <Text Key="AF8D648A">Want to hear my favorite Henford ghost story? It's the one about Maybell Watson. She was a local girl who used to ride her cute little bicycle around Old New Henford. It always had two fresh baskets of flowers, one on the front and one behind the seat. Maybell picked the flowers herself every morning down by the River Bagley. Well, one morning, she got up early before sunrise to go pick flowers like she did every other day. But on this day, she never came home and nobody ever saw her ever again. Some say she ran away, but others swear that if you look out over Olde Mill Lane in the early morning, you can see a bicycle with two flower baskets - one in the front and one in the back - riding itself along the dirt path, heading back up Olde Mill Hill, bringing the little Watson girl home.</Text>
  <Text Key="5BA23F66">Oh, and I foraged an extra mushroom that you can have. Try making a soup from it!</Text>
  <Text Key="41D1FAA8">Well, if you want to make yourself useful for once, you could always fetch me some butter crumpets. I like mine fluffy... just like your brain! I jest, of course.</Text>
  <Text Key="6CCC1E5E">I have let certain men into my life in the past - Robert, Erik - but nothing good came of it. I spend my time with Agatha and my plants nowadays and that's enough for me.</Text>
  <Text Key="5B2A8DCA">Why can't I stand public displays of affection? How can anyone? Hmm — well, I suppose we have gotten close. You see, I was in love once. And? And it didn't end well.</Text>
  <Text Key="219426D5">I will admit that one thing I don't entirely hate is a well-constructed, high-quality cross-stitch. Now that's a proper use of a Sim's time.</Text>
  <Text Key="D571CC52">Well, since I don't absolutely despise you, I'll let you in on a secret... I'm not actually from Finchwick. Have you ever heard of the Goths?</Text>
  <Text Key="A99C7280">I love dressing up the animals. In fact, I could make an outfit for you if you've got the raw materials. I've known other locals to hand them out as 'thank yous' for helping out, too.\n\nI used to know a rooster named Sir Crowstoosoon. Wore a top hat all the time. Very proper. Got his feathers ruffled quite easily. Oh, I do miss that rooster. Not in the morning, mind you.</Text>
  <Text Key="F498C95E">I get a lot of gifts from my creatures, given how close I am with them. I never get rainbow eggs, though. Not that I'm complaining. I love the gifts they give me. I just also happen to love rainbow eggs.</Text>
  <Text Key="989C9C73">My first animal friend was a little bunny named Boo. It took a long time for me to befriend her, but once I did, we were inseparable. I'd visit her every day. We really had a special bond.</Text>
  <Text Key="944763DB">I used to know a fox named Mable. She was such a miscreant! Always chasing chickens and stealing eggs! Normal fox behavior, really, but she seemed to especially enjoy it. She once stole a golden egg from a man from Old New Henford just to watch him cry.</Text>
  <Text Key="5588EE04">I once saw a Sim fight a rabbit and lose. As in, they &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; lost. Their life. You think rabbits are all cute and fuzzy - and they are - but one must respect them!</Text>
  <Text Key="C3661DF3">Did you ever hear the tragedy of Garden Gnome the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the other villagers will tell you.</Text>
  <Text Key="91E74776">Agnes is my cousin and we've known each other since we were little girls. Honestly, she could stand to loosen up a little. Like me. I'm the fun one. Then again, I haven't gone through what she has.</Text>
  <Text Key="547CA8DA">You know, it was either run a garden cart or start my very own match-making service, but the gnomes really were taken by the flowers, so it was an obvious choice.</Text>
  <Text Key="B23D3B50">Few actually know about the Order of Gnomes. But I do! And it is real — but you didn't hear that from me.</Text>
  <Text Key="772637B5">Have you met my boyfriend of the week? He's a garden gnome. I do love garden gnomes. He won my heart with some jam crumpets - another of my favorites.</Text>
  <Text Key="116CFF05">I get so much cheese from everyone. It's the traditional Finchwick Favor from the locals. I suppose there are worse problems than too much cheese.</Text>
  <Text Key="3FBA9F81">It is perfectly safe to go swimming in River Bagley. Some people tend to shy away, because of a ghost story, but that's none of my business. If that kind of tale tickles your fancy, you should go talk to the Pub Owner.</Text>
  <Text Key="3C1EAFDC">Did you know that Old New Henford was originally called 'Little Henford,' but they tried to rename it 'New Henford' so that it would sound more posh? But nobody told the mapmakers and it disappeared from the maps entirely! It was a whole ado and in the end needed yet another new name and here we are today.</Text>
  <Text Key="FB2A683B">Olde Mill Lane in Old New Henford received its name after the mill was built here in Finchwick. People still call the mill in the village 'the New Mill' but by this point, it's older than almost anyone living here now.</Text>
  <Text Key="2EC79B9B">Long ago, ancient druids ran a temple on the Isle of Volpe, deep in the Bramblewood. They shared a special connection with the foxes there. At least, that's what all the elders in the village have always told me.</Text>
  <Text Key="AE7A627B">Well, it is customary to gift the Finchwick Grocery Owner with cheese. It's expected around here. It's simply what one does!</Text>
  <Text Key="1D9D0E62">Well, the Bramblewood's very own Creature Keeper clearly loves animals, but if there's one favor that they seem to always be seeking, it's a rainbow egg.</Text>
  <Text Key="A2B72483">Yorkshire Pudding. Not just a scrumptious snack, but also the traditional favor for the Grocery Deliverer in Henford-on-Bagley.</Text>
  <Text Key="E2E61DD4">What's the traditional favor to give the Finchwick Mayor? Why do you ask? Should I be expecting something? It's a medium-sized pumpkin, of course! Nothing too big and nothing too small, if you please.</Text>
  <Text Key="533D917D">Don't tell her I said anything, but there's one surefire way to get in Ms. Agnes Crumplebottom's good graces: the right Finchwick Favor. She's a sucker for high quality cross-stitches and butter crumpets.</Text>
  <Text Key="A7FCF1AE">Agatha is far easier to get along with than her cousin. Still, if you want to really make her day, she's always in the mood for jam crumpets, and everyone knows how much she loves her garden gnomes. </Text>
  <Text Key="99F14054">Dating back over a hundred years, it's a local Finchwick tradition to give the Pub Owner cottage pie. Why? I'm not sure, really. But we wouldn't want to break tradition, now, would we?</Text>
  <Text Key="BDC5202C">I haven't heard anything lately... at least, not that I'd share with you.</Text>
  <Text Key="CEEA3106">Apologies, but I'm quite busy and have no good gossip for you.</Text>
  <Text Key="88ECD021">I'm not sure I'm of a mind to engage in such idle chitchat with you.</Text>
  <Text Key="C2B2A54C">You want to hear a real secret? I find you distasteful! Ha.</Text>
  <Text Key="556EB487">Oh my dear, have you been getting into that biscuit jar again? You know those will go straight to your hips.</Text>
  <Text Key="8E815652">The NERVE of some people! Public displays of affection in MY town is not something I tolerate. You'd best behave yourself around here if you don't want to get on my bad side!</Text>
  <Text Key="CABA5033">Why buy mushrooms and berries from the shops when you could be foraging in the Bramblewood and Old New Henford for free?</Text>
  <Text Key="A15434D2">Chocoberries can be hard to find. That's common knowledge. What they don't know is that there are some growing on the Isle of Volpe in the Bramblewood. Shhhh. Don't tell anyone!</Text>
  <Text Key="724D8582">If you've got an excess of any berry but find yourself in need of another, I hear the Creature Keeper's the one to see for a helpful berry trade.</Text>
  <Text Key="51610022">If you truly want to live your best life, there's a lot to learn from the creatures. Take the clever foxes we see around here. They're adaptable, perceptive, strategic, persistent — sometimes a touch too much. Be like the fox and you are bound to succeed.</Text>
  <Text Key="43DFBC13">You know what my Nan used to say? When times were hard, she'd say, 'This too shall pass.' And she was always right. She also said, 'It's a poor mother bird who has a poo in their own nest.' Which is also true, but probably not directly applicable advice right now.</Text>
  <Text Key="22B4356D">Sims always come to me for life advice. You know what I tell them? Take it slow. Sometimes you try to do life on fast-forward and your needs get out of hand.</Text>
  <Text Key="40D82007">The critters love it when you spend time with them. I speak to them all the time. I tell them about my day. About what I ate. Dates I've gone on... that were awkward... and regretful — uh, where were we? The critters! Right. Yes, very good listeners.</Text>
  <Text Key="67EBE78E">The happier your animals are, the higher quality goods they'll produce. If you want nice eggs, keep happy chickens! Quality milk comes from well-socialized cows. And the fluffiest of wools grows on the cleanest of llamas.</Text>
  <Text Key="AC9CE39D">Rabbits, birds, and foxes love to get gifts! Well, don't we all? If you want to get close to one of them, try figuring out what gifts it likes. Before you know it, it might be bringing you gifts from the woods, too.</Text>
  <Text Key="59A49FBA">No one enjoys being spit on, not really, and that includes foxes! If you've been having some fox troubles, having a llama in the right place to gob that bandit could be just the ticket.</Text>
  <Text Key="7A600893">Those foxes can be quite sly but I once saw a rooster take one on - beak primed, knives out, feathers flying - and give it what for, such that the fox had to admit defeat and slunk off in shame!</Text>
  <Text Key="BB8F87CC">I've got a spot of extra food. Would you be a dear and accept it? Enjoy it for me, will you?</Text>
  <Text Key="9EA3CAD7">I've got some rabbits and birds helping out with my garden. The rabbits do their business and fertilize the plants, and the birds sing to the little sprouts. Plants are social creatures too, you know!</Text>
  <Text Key="8F1A4518">Why not get the children involved in gardening? Teach them about plants. Let them get their hands dirty. It's good for their minds.</Text>
  <Text Key="96EA1CB2">It may go without saying, but if you want to grow an oversized crop, they need room to breathe. You can't just shove them into one of those little planters. Make sure they have their own gardening patch.</Text>
  <Text Key="6A2343E7">It's all rather simple. Pruning is important. Watering is essential. Fertilizer! Well, there are multiple types of fertilizer. Some make your plants grow quicker or healthier. Others improve quality. Some cause the plant to produce more fruit. It's important to use the right fertilizer to fit your needs. So, not so simple then.</Text>
  <Text Key="408C5E6C">Where do you get seeds? Well, obviously from the Crumplebottom Garden Stall in Finchwick. I suppose you could shop on the computer or order them through a grocery delivery service, but why buy from anywhere but the best? Perhaps I'm biased.</Text>
  <Text Key="9988A7FE">If you want your food to keep for a long time and you've got a stove, try canning it! You can can all sorts of things: pumpkins, lettuce, watermelons. And if you add a bit of sugar to your fruit, you get jam. Who doesn't love jam?</Text>
  <Text Key="0E157F1A">Cooking together can be good for your relationship. Think of it as a recipe for romance. Or companionship. Whatever you're looking for, really.</Text>
  <Text Key="6A37EE48">The better the ingredients you use, the better your recipe will turn out. My grocery stall has always got some fresh ingredients that'll be sure to enhance any recipe of yours.</Text>
  <Text Key="CE826134">What am I looking for when judging at the Finchwick Fair? Well, I'll always reward higher quality, rarity, size, and weight. And I do take into account how happy and clean the animals are. I'm quite chuffed by happy animals.</Text>
  <Text Key="C93F5274">Happy, clean animals always place better at the Finchwick Fair. Sad animals simply dampen the mood.</Text>
  <Text Key="29B485E8">Some people try to bribe me at the Finchwick Fair. To them, I say: don't try it unless you can make it worth my while! Ha! I'm clearly joking!</Text>
  <Text Key="2F6E3E7E">The well in the center of Finchwick used to be filled with water, but a certain elderly local hit someone so hard with her purse that they almost fell in! After that, the mayor had it drained and filled with flowers.</Text>
  <Text Key="01807D90">Some people say Lord Volpe, the founder of Finchwick, had a pet fox, while others insist that he had a pet snail. There are no definitive records either way, but I like to think that Sophie the Snail is proof positive that he was a snail man. Why else would there be a snail maze in the Bramblewood?</Text>
  <Text Key="21C5D535">Before the bridge-building frenzy a few hundred years back - you'd think the village was called Bridgertown or something - you'd have to swim if you wanted to cross the River Bagley. Sims would always have their swimming clothes handy when doing errands around town!</Text>
  <Text Key="F4B8A020">Even though Finchwick has grown from the days when it was nothing more than a cemetery and an aubergine seller, it still feels like the sort of place where we're all willing to help each other out.</Text>
  <Text Key="9372C770">It's rumored young nobles on secret holiday used to abscond to the cottage at the top of Cordelia Falls in the Bramblewood. Oh, to have seen what they did when they thought no one was watching!</Text>
  <Text Key="29E212ED">Finchwick was beset by pirates once! Princess Cordelia was visiting and it's rumored that she brought those scallywags as company. Then again, perhaps beset isn't quite the term to us, as they were all very polite while they were here. In fact, they're the ones who started the whole Finchwick Favor tradition!</Text>
  <Text Key="FBCCA4BA">One of the most romantic places in the Henford-on-Bagley area are the old Isle of Volpe ruins in the Bramblewood. Getting a kiss from your love when wrapped in their arms - why, it's like a scene from a movie. Don't we all want our happily ever after?</Text>
  <Text Key="699C93D0">The Watson family used to own the entirety of the Old New Henford area, but over hundreds of years, they've been selling off plots one by one. I wouldn't be surprised if the half the headstones in the Finchwick cemetery were Watsons.</Text>
  <Text Key="89881A91">Did you know that the sunny flowers hanging in the lampposts around town all come from local gardens? Those in Finchwick are tended by any Sim with a spare moment, while others come from the homes of Henford-on-Bagley residents. In a way, their brightness is a reflection of the light we all shine on each other.</Text>
  <Text Key="7214BF9F">Finchwick was so named due to all the greenfinches in the area. Lord Volpe loved the way they sang to each other. We also have robins, great tits, willow tits, goldcrests, and blackcaps for any Sim looking to do a bit of birding.</Text>
  <Text Key="5AF94BB5">Even though property values in the Bramblewood have risen quite steadily over the past few years, some who've lived in Henford-on-Bagley for quite some time have sworn they won't sell to those looking to turn the woods into the next hot vacation destination, or whatever it is they put on their brochures.</Text>
  <Text Key="9A6EC6AB">A few years back, someone renovated a historic barn in the Old New Henford area. I love seeing history preserved in special ways like that, a reminder that we don't have to leave our pasts behind to move forward.</Text>
  <Text Key="B0CF840F">The ruins on the hill outside of Finchwick used to be a lord's manor - a grand house that looked over all of Henford-on-Bagley. If you look closely, you can still see them all the way from Old New Henford.</Text>
  <Text Key="6D164E4B">Well, if you're looking for the best place to fish in the Henford-on-Bagley area, you'll want to stop by Old New Henford and visit the pond at the base of Olde Mill Hill. I once knew a Sim who claims to have caught a wolf eel there!</Text>
  <Text Key="EEBDE3DD">Simply because Old New Henford has been around for a while doesn't mean things don't change. Take the community garden, for example. An enterprising neighbor started it a few years back and the entire community has ensured that it's really taken off.</Text>

  <Text Key="A39558A1">The very first Finchwick Fair? Well, it all started years ago when old Arley Watson wanted to show off his beloved llama, Chicken. No, not some sort of hybridized llama-chicken creature, but rather his llama that he had affectionately named Chicken! What a winner she was! Chicken was a very intelligent and friendly llama and Sims came from all around Henford-on-Bagley to meet her! It's no wonder that the fair became a regular tradition afterwards.</Text>

  <Text Key="238FE216">Love is in the air! Can you feel it? Well, perhaps it needs a slight nudge from yours truly - Henford-on-Bagley's own self-appointed matchmaker. Roses are known to help budding relationships blossom, and I've entrusted you with two of them. Offer them to two single Sims who would make the perfect pair, and see if they fall for each other.\n\nI also need your help selling some extra inventory Agnes and I have at our Garden Shop.

  <Text Key="F4F9B9B0">Ah, yes, I knew I could count on you! Let's take a journey, you and I.\n\nI'll need you to get me some chocoberries and spicy mushrooms so I can make you a special mash. It may taste a bit odd, but I think you'll find it gives you real insight into some of the creatures around here. Enough talk! Let's do the mash - the mushroom mash!</Text>
  <Text Key="C71BFE93">My stomach is empty and my appetite is roaring. An Aubergine Parmesan would fill me right up! And as long as you're so graciously indulging me, Pumpkin Scones to finish my meal sounds scrumptious. Just a single serving of each please; I wouldn't want to be greedy after all.</Text>
  <Text Key="3C5F64AE">Do you ever get cravings for chocolate? That's me, right now. But... I still want to eat healthy. I'll compromise and enjoy a fresh Chocoberry instead, assuming you're able to bring me one.</Text>
  <Text Key="B9E299CE">I could really go for a mushroom snack right now. They're nature's gift to my highly refined palate, and I wouldn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth, now would I? Now, please -- bring me some mushrooms!</Text>
  <Text Key="1C0293D8">I'm feeling a mite peckish, and some Blueberries seem like just the right pick-me-up. Nothing beats the freshly picked Blueberries that grow around town, but really -- any Blueberries will do!</Text>
  <Text Key="213BF9FE">I've got Raspberries on my mind. As I child, I would roam the countryside and pick wild Raspberries -- what a treat! Would you bring me some so I can relive a favorite childhood memory?</Text>
  <Text Key="C24C9298">Oh, just thinking of a perfectly cooked Beef Wellington is making my mouth water. Are you skilled enough to prepare this culinary delight? I'd be ever so grateful were you to bring me one. And... I may be pushing my luck, but I love pairing a Beef Welly with a hunk of Cheese. So cheese, if you please?</Text>
  <Text Key="392238E1">I'll be the first to tell you, I love a good raspberry. It's my favorite fruit, don'tcha know? For some reason, admitting this to others results in peals of laughter. You're not going to laugh at me, are you? No? Good! Get moving then and get me a raspberry please.</Text>
  <Text Key="C41FAF55">When my sweet tooth starts aching, I slap my hand to scold myself and speak aloud, "Now {1.SimFirstName}... No sweet treats, not a single one!", and then I scarf down some berries to satisfy my cravings. I'm afraid my cravings are coming on again. Please, bring me a blueberry!</Text>
  <Text Key="347F585D">Everyone laughs when I say I need an aubergine. I don't understand... what's so funny about that? If you can just help an old lady out and give me an aubergine without any snickering, giggling, laughing, or snide comments, there's a nice reward in it for you.</Text>
  <Text Key="F91FFD4D">Sometimes I daydream of Prince Charming, pumpkin carriages, and fairytales from my youth. But that's a silly flight of fancy, and I'm a sensible woman. Still... isn't it nice to fantasize? Bring me a pumpkin so that I might dream again, if only for a moment.</Text>
  <Text Key="4AD718E9">Is there a greater sensation than being out in the countryside with the sun shining down, and biting into a juicy watermelon? No, I think not. Please bring me a watermelon so that I might enjoy this simple pleasure yet again.</Text>
  <Text Key="B3AEAE11">Lettuce wraps are the key to maintaining my fit figure. Bread? Be gone! To sustain this diet though, I need more lettuce. Bring me some so that I might plant even more of it in my garden.</Text>
  <Text Key="03CDC529">Golden wool... It's the stuff of legends. But whispers on the wind have made their way to my ears, and I hear golden wool may be more than a myth. Might you acquire some for me? You'll be handsomely rewarded!</Text>
  <Text Key="4B28FEBE">Ever since I heard murmurs of a milk as black as night, I knew I had to get my hands on this forbidden beverage. Please, I implore you... bring me a taste, and don't whisper a word of this exchange to anyone.</Text>
  <Text Key="F07C3A40">Do I dare ask for a golden egg? Yes, I do dare. It's unquestionably a delicacy, and today's the day I treat myself. Please, do what it takes to track one down and you'll be richly rewarded.</Text>
  <Text Key="065A692A">I trust you, but I'd be shunned by the other villagers if my secret got out. I don't like drinking tea! I tolerate that swill among friends just for the ability to swirl in some delicious milk and honey. That said, golden honey milk exists for Sims just like me. All the flavor, and none of that nasty tea! Bring me some, but keep quiet about it.</Text>
  <Text Key="8D733981">There's a simply fabulous wool that I absolutely must have. Dare I say, this llama's wool will be six times harder than any other I could ask you to procure? You've guessed it; it's wool from a rainbow llama that I seek!</Text>

You've been awfully impressive as of late, what say you capitalize on your skills and submit an entry to a future festival for judging?</Text>
  <Text Key="7102122F">The first time I saw a green llama, I wondered if the poor dear was feeling a bit sickly. Turns out they're perfectly healthy though! And I must admit... I'm drawn to their gorgeous green wool. Won't you help bring me some?</Text>
  <Text Key="72E3BC60">I've been on a bit of a nutrition kick as of late, and enriched milk has become a staple of my diet. That said, it can be hard to come by in a little town like Henford-on-Bagley. You may be my last hope to source some, short of having it shipped from the city. Can you help?</Text>
  <Text Key="C33E4CE0">I'm no spring chicken. Every day that passes is a day I grow older. I can swear I hear my bones creaking! Would you please be a {M0.pal}{F0.dear} and bring me some milk, to help me feel good and strong?</Text>
  <Text Key="4C45980B">I've found blue eggs to have a subtly sweet taste that I've come to crave. The only problem? They're hard to come by; they don't exactly occur naturally in the wild! I've got excellent rewards to share with the first Sim to bring me another one of those succulent blue eggs.</Text>
  <Text Key="519BA0BC">From a young age we're told stories of green eggs and dream of someday eating one. Well now that I'm all grown up, I can choose to have green eggs whenever I please! Sadly, they're rare to come by. Could you help track one down for me?</Text>
  <Text Key="1F2E86A3">I'll admit, I did a double take the first time I saw a blue llama. But they're incredible creatures, and I'm not one to judge! Bring me some of their beautiful blue wool and I'll make it worth your while.</Text>
  <Text Key="9CD23B66">Oranges and eggs... they're both wonderful for breakfast on their own, but people keep insisting they're even better when infused together. I haven't tried an Orange Egg that I've liked yet, but I'm always willing to give it another go. Could you bring me one? </Text>
  <Text Key="E5BA0B4D">White llama wool is a staple 'round these parts. I can never have enough to keep the shop's shelves stocked. What say you save me the hassle of finding a llama to shear, and I'll reward you kindly for your time.</Text>
  <Text Key="74DADB56">I'm slightly embarrassed to admit this, so please keep what I'm about to say between us... I used to laugh at people who started craving pumpkin spice flavor in anything and everything, but now I can't get enough. Could you please bring me some Pumpkin Spice Milk?!</Text>
  <Text Key="98E5E87D">Call me traditional; a nice fluffy white Llama is all I need. But customers at the Grocery Shop are asking more and more about exotic orange llama wool. It's rare that we receive stock in that color, so it'd be wonderful if you could help source some.</Text>
  <Text Key="119ACFF2">Eggs are a true delight. Gulp three down raw, scramble another three on the stove, and I'm ready to power through my day. I'd certainly appreciate if you could bring me a half dozen so that I start tomorrow off on the right foot!</Text>
  <Text Key="0CDAEB1F">Customers have been asking for Beige Llama wool lately -- I suppose they want a smidge more color in their lives? Please, bring some so that the Grocery Shop will have more of it to sell.</Text>
  <Text Key="B367D771">I've been trying to convince myself to go vegetarian lately, but haven't taken the plunge. Would you be so kind as to bring me some mighty plant milk? Maybe it'll push me over the edge this time!</Text>
  <Text Key="D99DCAF0">It drives me mad knowing there's tawdry gossip being exchanged, and let me tell you - my ears are burning! Most of the locals know my face, but perhaps they won't see you coming. Listen in on any gossipers you spot and clue me in on what's being said.</Text>
  <Text Key="4F32A4BB">There's a Sim out there right now gifting delicious pies when we all least expect it! We'll be minding our own business and suddenly, BAM! There's a pie. It's disconcerting and delicious, and I need you to ferret out who it may be.\n\nAsk around, though be aware that confessing to this sort of thing isn't something someone just does! While I trust our villagers to not lie to your face, you may need to get in their good graces before they come clean.</Text>
  <Text Key="E3141AC4">Oh wonderful; thank you for your continued help. I've been busy as a bee, and my backlog of tasks to tend to is getting unbearably long! But with you here to share the load, no doubt it'll be a productive day. </Text>
  <Text Key="F5A8858F">Have I mentioned that I'm an ornithologist hobbyist? Oh, silly me... I suppose that comes off a bit snooty. Really, I just enjoy watching birds, and would love to have a fellow bird watcher to banter with. What's that they, say... "birds of a feather", and all that good stuff? Go find some birds to watch; maybe you'll enjoy it!</Text>
  <Text Key="8A01025A">Chitter chatter, pitter patter, the bunnies run to-and-fro... Oh, my heart just swells when I think about the sweet conversations I've had with my rabbit friends, but it can be so difficult getting them to slow down and say hello! I promise it's worth the effort though... Just scrunch your face up and try your best at wiggling your nose, and you'll be communicating with these sweet buns in no time.</Text>
  <Text Key="87F73A99">Can you outfox a fox? I'm not trying to be clever, I'm literally asking you to to go watch the local fox population! Increased fox sightings have been reported across Henford-on-Bagley, and I want you to observe them and ensure they're still getting on just fine.</Text>
  <Text Key="671E8154">What does the fox say? Wait, don't answer. That's a rhetorical question, because you haven't gone and talked to one yet. Come {M0.man}{F0.woman}; am I not making myself clear? Run along and talk to a fox! I must know what's on our woodland's friend's minds.</Text>
  <Text Key="EC0197A6">Hip hop, to the hippity hop, hip hip hop and they don't stop! Sorry -- please don't mind me, my mind turns to mush when I think about just. how. &lt;i&gt;cute&lt;/i&gt;. those adorable little rabbits are! Go watch some rabbits from afar; you'll soon love them and wish to help care for them just as much as I do!</Text>

Of course, Jack Whittler won, teaching everyone that sometimes you really can judge a book by its cover... or in this case by its last name.\nEveryone later learned that Jack Whittler had earned his last name in a previous whittling competition, which is how folk used to get last names back in those days. Jack went on to whittle plenty of other notable items around Henford-on-Bagley, but these kitchen counters were some of his finest work.</Text>

They'd keep them wherever they could: the corner, the middle of the room, in a backpack. None of those were a good idea and led to many unhappy times and burnt eyebrows. Then one day, the idea came to have a place for the fire to live that was contained. Since it was a place to keep fire, it made sense to call it a fireplace, and thus began the tradition of keeping fire contained within a structure. Eureka!</Text>

She carried with her a wrought iron lantern that was a tad scuffed, but shone brightly nonetheless. She had come to Finchwick to solve the heinous crime of herbicide. Someone had ripped up all of the pubs herb garden and left a set of curious footprints. If there's anyone who could get to the bottom of this horrid scene, it was Christina.&lt;i&gt;To be continued...&lt;/i&gt;</Text>

  <Text Key="AD29DF64">Detective Christina Agate shone her wrought iron lantern at the ground and took a long look at the set of footprints embedded in the soil. "That's odd." She exclaimed. There were two sets of footprints, both identical in weight. Solving the mystery of who obliterated this herb garden was going to take some thinking. Good thing her trusty lantern is by her side! Christina laid out a map of the town, as well as a giant corkboard of suspects interconnected with string.

  <Text Key="0395D9FF">Detective Christina Agate had been in Finchwick for several days now poring over evidence from a brutal crime scene: the destruction of the pub's beloved herb garden. As she was staring at her homemade crime map of the vicinity and suspects, the storm knocked the power out. Thankfully, she still had her wrought iron lantern with her.\n "This doesn't make sense." Christina pondered. "Why would there be two sets of bootprints leading to and from the crime scene, both so evenly spaced? It's almost like the perpetrator was tied together with their partner in crime. But that's poppycock! Or is it?" Christina stared pensively out the window, holding up her lantern. "Aha! Of course!" She trekked over to the pasture across the way, and sure enough, spotted the criminal: a cow wearing two sets of wellington boots! "Mooo?" The cow's breath still smelled faintly of rosemary and thyme.\n"I've caught you, you naughty boot-wearing cow!" Christina broke the news to the farmer who owned the cow, and agreed to donate milk to the pub for free for a whole year.

  <Text Key="53273AE4">Years ago a peddler came to the town of Finchwick and offered a nice variety of items for surprisingly low prices. He claimed this chandelier was originally from a haunted opera house which was trashed after some "mischievous goings on." No one can be sure if the peddler was telling the truth or just read too much opera ghost fiction, but either way, it's a pretty little chandelier.</Text>

  <Text Key="19672675">What were the "mysterious goings on" in the haunted opera house? Which opera house are we talking about? The Peddler's tales left the citizens of Henford-on-Bagley mesmerized... and a tad afraid. We think this is the perfect case for Detective Christina Agate, will she be able to solve this? We wished this was the case!</Text>

  <Text Key="14CF15AA">Pretty little chandelier or not, this lamp... well, the longer it is, the more terrified the citizens are of it. The Peddler reassured the townfolk that the lamps were safe, that he had traveled with them for years and nothing happened... but the doubt still remained even after he left all those years ago. The tales of the old opera house lamp remained as urban legend... but can we rest assured it is actually fiction? We may never get to know, maybe it is better that way.</Text>

Her will stipulated that the frogs were to dress in clothing and run the B&amp;B. After it failed miserably due to frogs not being able to read calendars, cook, or speak, it became abandoned and items were auctioned off. These lovely botanical inspired sconces are some of the last remaining items to be salvaged. Supposedly the frogs used to congregate underneath them at dinnertime since they would attract delicious bugs. Ribbit!</Text>

  <Text Key="6D9707CF">In the olden days, chairs were made for brief bouts of sitting, but never for lounging, lollygagging or lazing. There were just too many chores to be done for any of that nonsense. It wasn't until Lawrence the Loafer graced Henford-on-Bagley with his leisurely presence that folk started taking to the idea of having a nice long sit. Lawrence the Loafer tied a cushion to a simple wooden chair and suddenly, he was the talk of the town. Buns all over were supported and cushioned, and for the first time, the country way of life was once again peaceful and relaxing. So the next time you sink onto a comfy cushiony seat, remember the chair that started it all. </Text>

  <Text Key="F7DD36AE">Once a year, on ghost appreciation day, the tables at the Sir Conan O’Brian Arthur Doyle Inn at Barkersville get all dressed up in ghostly costume to revel in a truly unusual experience of the paranormal variety. The legend originated the night the tables turned on the good residents of Barkersville Manor. At the dinner hour, everyone had been seated and served around a large round table when a bone chilling scream rang out! It seems that Lady Doyle had ordered chips with her fish and had gotten mashed instead. That was what Sir Doyle had ordered. In fact everyone had been served the dish meant for the person to the right of them. Suddenly, the table bolted straight up off the ground, paused for a moment and slowly rotated slightly counter-clockwise and softly returned to the floor. Happy but a bit rattled, everyone enjoyed what they had ordered.</Text>

  <Text Key="2FB0A490">This end table was salvaged from an old B&amp;B called The Frog's Wallow that was torn down years ago. It was previously owned by an eccentric dowager who left the estate to her pet frogs after she passed away. Her will stipulated that the frogs were to dress in clothing and run the B&amp;B. While the plan was quite whimsical on paper and drew in lots of business initially, people soon realized frogs are not well suited to run an establishment. Instead of tending to the daily duties of the inn, the frogs just sat around in ill-fitted suits, hopping around the premises and peeing on guests whenever they were picked up. Fun fact: frog pee is cold. There's something you don't learn in school.\nLong story short, after the B&amp;B went under, all the furniture was auctioned off, including this adorable table.</Text>

  <Text Key="2FD5D025">After the Great Sloth Invasion, Princess Cordelia was forced to flee her palace with few belongings and take refuge in the country. One of the first places she settled was Henford-on-Bagley. She spent lots of time enjoying the countryside, and a simpler way of life.\nOne such novel experience for her was the concept of going up and down stairs. In her palace, her family prided themselves on efficiency and so she always had a stair butler who carried her up and down stairs.\nSince she had to fire all of her staff during the Great Sloth Invasion, unfortunately the stair butler could not join her in Henford-on-Bagley.\nOn the bright side, she experienced climbing this very set of stairs for the first time. She referred to them as "peasant stairs" and wrote about them in her diary. There's a first time for everything. And if you're in the market for a good stair-butler, hers is still looking for work.</Text>

  <Text Key="7D7876AD">Chickens make Eggs and some Eggs make Chickens! Which came first? The Chicken Coop! Purchase the Coop in Build Mode and then Sims can purchase Hens, Roosters, and Chicks from it.\n\nChickens sleep in the Coop at night. Sims can call them outside at any time.</Text>
  <Text Key="7C8A6684">Visit the Creature Keeper next to the Volpe Island ruins in The Bramblewood to purchase outfits. The stock rotates daily! If you bring Llama Wool, the Creature Keeper even can craft outfits from it.\n\nVillagers seeking help may offer outfits as rewards for completing Village Errands around Henford-on-Bagley.</Text>
  <Text Key="803BC654">Sims with an outfit in their Inventory can approach the matching species of animal and "Dress" them. Clothed animals can try on other outfits or the Sim can "Take Clothes" back.</Text>
  <Text Key="4D58D765">Dressing up your animals in adorable outfits has no tangible benefits other than being heart-meltingly cute. Okay, maybe two benefits - it helps in telling animals apart. Outfits are available for Chickens, Cows, Foxes, Llamas, and Rabbits.</Text>
  <Text Key="88E5DDE8">Animals - Clothing</Text>
  <Text Key="650D2CC8">Foxes can be dealt with in other more direct ways though. Should a fox visit your lot with bad intentions, you can approach them and Shoo them away. If you're feeling proactive about protecting your Chicken Coop, Sims with the Handiness Skill can upgrade it with the "Fox Be-Gone Alarm".\n\nAnimals can also help ward off foxes. Roosters are natural foes to foxes; they'll aggressively pursue any fox in their proximity that approaches the Chicken Coop. Llamas are also fearless fox defenders. Llamas will spit at any fox in the nearby vicinity to scare them away. </Text>
  <Text Key="295389BF">Foxes roam the world of Henford-on-Bagley. Most often they keep their distance from residences, preferring to roam in secluded areas. In particular, they're commonly found near their fox den, located in the shade of the great tree at the Volpe Island ruins in the Bramblewood. However, if left unchecked, foxes can pose a threat to your garden, your chickens, your eggs, and any rabbits that are around. While a locked door poses no challenge to a sly fox, there are other ways to deal with them...</Text>
  <Text Key="A81449BB">As a player, you also have control over if you want to foxes to visit your lot. The "Wild Foxes" Lot Challenge can be applied to, or removed from, any lot within Build Mode. Lots that have this challenge applied (all lots in Henford-on-Bagley have this challenge by default), will have foxes occasionally visit the lot to steal from your garden, or attack your animals. You can also enable the Wild Foxes Lot Challenge in other worlds, so as to experience foxes in any location.</Text>
  <Text Key="8365DB11">A friendly way to neutralize any danger from the local fox population is simply by befriending them. Foxes love receiving gifts, but they're also generally happy just to socialize with any Sim who shows interest in spending time with them. They can be a bit mischievous at first, but they'll come around as you gain their trust. Once you're friends with a fox, you can approach them and "Ask Not to Steal". From that point on, as long as you maintain a friendly relationship with them, they'll willingly leave your garden and your critters alone.</Text>
  <Text Key="6A85DA16">Everyone knows the best thing about gifts... It's receiving them! Happily, Birds and Rabbits have gifts they want to share with those they befriend. When you see these animals thinking about a gift box, you'll know they have a gift they want to share. Select "Take Gift" from the animal. As the Sim's relationship with an animal improves, the gifts will only get better!</Text>
  <Text Key="FBEF137C">Each wild animal has their own preferences for gifts they dislike, like, and love. Sometimes Sims can try "Discover Gift Preferences" and the animal will share how they feel about a type of gift. More often, though, Sims need to offer a gift and note how the animal reacts. As Sims learn which types the animal likes, the question mark next to each type of gift becomes a thumbs up, thumbs down, or a heart so Sims know which to continue giving and which to avoid.</Text>
  <Text Key="E3AC4B9F">Gift giving is a great way to build friendship with Birds, Foxes, and Rabbits. Cooking food and then giving it to a wild animal is one of the easiest types, but there are many more options. When attempting to "Give Gift", you'll see a variety of gifts Sims can offer to gain their trust.</Text>
  <Text Key="8C4E86B5">Animals - Gifts</Text>
  <Text Key="E91E9CC3">Once you've located a Wild Rabbit, you can approach it and begin interacting with it. You can start slowly - choosing to observe them from a distance, or if you're feeling bold you may approach them and interact with them directly. See the Gifts for Wild Animals lesson for tips on how to quickly build a friendship with the various rabbits you'll encounter in Henford-on-Bagley!</Text>
  <Text Key="F5E9CF79">Rabbits are curious little critters who can be found hopping around in both Old New Henford and The Bramblewood. Should you live in those neighborhoods, don't be surprised to find cute bunnies burrowing their way into your yard to pay a visit. If you're looking for a rabbit in the wild though, try locating the stumps of cut down trees  that they call home near the banks of the River Bagley. When traveling within Henford-on-Bagley, you'll even find these tree stumps dotted on the map, to help you locate them within the world.</Text>
  <Text Key="7C913E57">...Oh, you're still reading? By now, you're probably thinking rabbits are all fluff and fun. But you'd be wrong. Do not... I repeat, &lt;b&gt;DO NOT&lt;/b&gt; get on a rabbit's bad side. The consequences can be disastrous. You've been warned...\n\n&lt;i&gt;Psst...&lt;/i&gt; Locking your doors won't save you. Rabbits can burrow right under them.</Text>
  <Text Key="24E58533">Building a friendship with a rabbit has its advantages. Not only are they fun for Sims of nearly every age, but rabbits are wonderful at helping tend to nearby gardens. If you live in Old New Henford or The Bramblewood, you can ask rabbits living in the neighborhood to help with gardening, and you'll find they'll nibble on any weeds that pop up to allow your plants to grow healthy and strong! In addition, rabbits find Garden Patches to be tantalizing toilets... Their little pellets of poop will naturally fertilize the Oversized Crops in your garden, helping them to grow nice and large!</Text>
  <Text Key="66530EBF">Even if you're not a local, befriending the rabbits in Henford-on-Bagley has clear benefits. Once you're friends with any Wild Rabbit, you can purchase a rabbit home for your own home with all of the gardening benefits they can bestow. Find it in the Build Mode catalog by searching for "Wild Rabbit Home". Soon you will have rabbits darting across your lawn!</Text>
  <Text Key="709EC34D">Building a friendship with a Flock of Wild Birds has its advantages. Not only will you have a flock of feathered friends, but birds are quite adept at assisting with nearby gardens. Should you call Old New Henford or The Bramblewood your Sims' home, you can ask the local flock to help with gardening, and you'll find they'll keep your garden free of pesky insects. They'll also sing their lilting bird song to your Oversized Crops, helping them grow faster and even larger!</Text>
  <Text Key="00E563C7">Once you've located a Flock of Wild Birds, you can approach their home and begin interacting with them. You can start slowly - choosing to observe them from a distance, or if you're feeling bold you may approach them and interact with them directly. Should they enjoy your banter, you'll find yourself building a friendship with the entire flock that calls the tree trunk their home.</Text>
  <Text Key="2D13E269">Even if you're not a local, befriending the birds in Henford-on-Bagley has clear benefits. Once you're friends with one of the flocks, you can purchase a bird home for your own home along with all of the gardening benefits they can bestow. Find it in the Build Mode catalog by searching for "Flock of Wild Birds". Soon you will have birds flitting to-and-fro outside your windows!</Text>
  <Text Key="171029D4">Flocks of Wild Birds can be found in the countryside of both Old New Henford and The Bramblewood. They live within rotting tree trunks on the shores of the River Bagley. When traveling within Henford-on-Bagley, you'll even find these tree trunks dotted on the map, to help you locate them within the world.</Text>

  <Text Key="63067E66">As you complete errands for the different villagers, individual villagers will begin to entrust you with more challenging errands that offer a wider range of rewards. Continue to visit them daily to see what errands they need help with.</Text>
  <Text Key="B9ED8372">Certain villagers living in Henford-on-Bagley have errands that they'd appreciate your help with. These are Sims that have special roles within the village, such as the Mayor, the Pub Owner, and many others. The best way to get acquainted with these Sims is by visiting the Information Board in Finchwick's square. There, you'll find the names of these villagers, their roles, and what they look like.</Text>
  <Text Key="A307FA77">Once you've located one of these special villagers, you can interact with them and "Offer Help With Errands". They'll be happy to let you know various tasks that they currently need assistance with. You can select up to three errands to work on simultaneously, and there's no time limit to complete them. Different errands from different villagers will provide different rewards, so be sure to meet everyone in the town to see what they're offering.</Text>
  <Text Key="3E907207">After you've started an errand, you'll find information on what tasks you must complete within your Sim's Career Panel. As tasks are completed, new tasks may appear. Once all tasks are checked off, you'll receive your rewards! If you're ever feeling stuck and don't know how to complete a task, hover your cursor over the task to see a tooltip with more explicit information on what must be done to progress.</Text>
  <Text Key="4ED9E085">Village Errands</Text>
  <Text Key="8DA32912">The Villagers' special title displays above their name when you hover over them. You also can "Learn about Villagers" from a Henford-on-Bagley Community Information Sign to see who's who.  Finchwick's village square and Old New Henford’s community garden both have this sign. </Text>
  <Text Key="884FE278">Henford-on-Bagley is a close-knit community run by a handful of Sims with distinct roles. These include:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Garden Shop Owner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grocery Shop Owner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creature Keeper&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grocery Deliverer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mayor of Finchwick&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pub Owner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
  <Text Key="CB4BF0DE">But where can you find these Sims? Most of them often are in or around Finchwick’s village square in Henford-on-Bagley. The Pub Owner tends the local Bar. The Creature Keeper roams the Bramblewood, caring for the wild animals. Select the Creature Keeper’s house nestled across from the Isle of Volpe ruins to see his or her whereabouts.</Text>
  <Text Key="4E8F1265">Sims can give these locals a special gift called a Finchwick Favor once a day, a local tradition! Having a “Henford Heart-to-Heart” conversation with them might reveal what they would like. Then again, they might say something else unexpected, especially if they really like the Sim! While chatting with them, see if they could use a hand with anything with “Offer to Help with Errands…”. They are sure to reward helpful Sims.</Text>
  <Text Key="249C5B9C">Villagers</Text>
  <Text Key="94464FD3">Just like Sims, animals need to eat. \n\n&lt;b&gt;Chickens&lt;/b&gt;: Feed Chickens by selecting the Chicken itself or selecting the Chicken Coop to scatter feed for multiple chickens.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Cows and Llamas&lt;/b&gt;: The Animal Shed has a feed trough that Sims should keep stocked. The animals will eat on their own when food is available there. Sims also can feed them by hand. Don't worry about overfeeding - they'll never get too full.</Text>
  <Text Key="ACB68F8A">Animals that are Unhappy for too long eventually leave. Don't worry - A warning will appear well before this happens. To keep animals happy at home, just care for their needs by feeding, cleaning, and socializing.</Text>
  <Text Key="9458B968">Animals don't like being dirty - who does? (Okay, besides Slob Sims....)\n\n&lt;b&gt;Chickens&lt;/b&gt;: When left unattended, Chicken Coops get dirty. Sims can't clean chickens directly. Chickens preen themselves clean whenever they need to and are able. Sims can help keep their chickens clean by keeping the Chicken Coop clean.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Cows and Llamas&lt;/b&gt;: Just like Coops, Animal Sheds and their occupants get dirty over time. Sims can brush Cows and Llamas to clean them and have a nice moment together. Sims should clean out Animal Sheds every day or two.</Text>
  <Text Key="468242F0">An animal's desire for attention is shown by the Attention need.\n\nSims can socialize with animals in a variety of ways. The chance of that going well is better when the Sim is in a good mood and the animal is Happy. Nearby animals gain some Attention, too, when those actions go well.\n\nIf socializing is not going well, hover over the animal to check for unmet needs that might be making the animal grouchy. (But if the animal hates a Sim that has been mean to them repeatedly, don't come crying to us.)</Text>
  <Text Key="98F19662">To keep Grim permanently away from animals, go to "Game Options" then choose "Pack Settings." Find the "Cottage Living" section and uncheck "Animal Aging." Note: This applies to wild animals as well, so Foxes and Rabbits also will not pass away.</Text>
  <Text Key="9659FADE">Chickens, Cows, and Llamas rely on Sims to take care of them and attend to their needs: Hygiene, Attention, and Hunger. All animals initially feel Fine. When all their needs are fulfilled, they become Happy!\n\nHover over an animal to see its Happiness level, status of needs, and other information such as life stage.</Text>
  <Text Key="6DB37C26">For better or worse, animals age just like Sims. Grim will come to collect animal that has reached the end of its life.\n\nHappier animals tend to live longer, but happiness isn't the only factor that affects animal aging. Look for other ways to prolong the life of animals in your Sims' care!</Text>
  <Text Key="2555754C">Having happy animals is more than a reason to be proud: happier animals produce higher quality ingredients and respond more positively when Sims interact with them! The opposite holds true for Unhappy animals.\n\nAnimals that stay Happy long enough will become Very Happy. If any of the animal's needs fall too low, it will need time to become Very Happy once again. Don't worry if this happens! Keep caring for your animals and they'll be Very Happy before you know it.</Text>
  <Text Key="44F270DD">Animals - Care</Text>
  <Text Key="F1979353">Hens lay eggs roughly twice a day. Sims can collect eggs directly from the Chicken Coop at any time, but morning is best. Eggs can be sold, used as ingredients, and used to make certain Animal Treats.\n\nChickens breed on their own as long as these conditions are met:\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least one Rooster and one Hen live in the Chicken Coop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Chicken Coop has room for more Chickens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\nOnce bred, a Hen has a chance of laying eggs that might hatch into Chicks!</Text>
  <Text Key="502D19CF">When a Sim collects eggs, check their Inventory to see if any of the eggs are fertilized!\n\nDrag or have the Sim place a hatchable egg in any available nest in a Chicken Coop. Up to three eggs can incubate in one coop and Hens returning to the coop will try to nest on them.

Success is more likely when the Sim is in a good mood and the Cow's needs are met. Cows always produce regular Milk and provide additional special types of milk when fed certain Animal Treats. (See "Animal Treats" for more on producing special Milks.)\n\nMilk can be consumed directly (lactose-intolerant Sims beware!), sold, and used in recipes. Special Milks confer various benefits.

Shearing doesn't require any skill, but Llamas are not famous for being nice. Increase chance of success by ensuring the Sim is in a good mood, and that the Llama's needs are all taken care of. Shearing produces Llama Wool that matches the Llama's current color, and will turn the Llama back to its natural color. (See "Animal Treats" for notes on changing Llama color.)\n\nLlama Wool can be sold, but has other uses, too. Use Llama Wool to reduce the cost of Cross-stitching or Knitting, or as a required ingredient in Animal Clothing. (The Creature Keeper can help!)\n\nShearing is optional: Sims cannot shear too much at a time, and unsheared Llamas don't experience any negative effects. (See "Animal Care" for notes on what is required care for animals.)</Text>

These can be used in certain recipes and some have particular short-term effects on the Sims who drink them. That Fire Milk is spicy!\n\nLastly, some treats have the same effect on Chickens, Cows, and Llamas. For example, the Friendly Treat improves a Sim’s relationship with any of these animals.</Text>

Initially known as Little Henford, the neighborhood renamed itself New Henford in an attempt to escape its diminutive origins. However, in neglecting to inform national mapmakers, they ceased to officially exist for a two-week period. When told that to be reinstated would require yet another name change, residents chose Old New Henford, which beat out the other choice - New New Henford - by a single vote.</Text>
