Seems Ernest was the kinda kid who ran pretty much everywhere he went. And that’s how he headed off to bed that night – runnin’ full tilt. When Ernie was jumping distance to his bed, he leapt a mighty leap. In fact, he missed it clean and hit the headboard that his daddy made out of old slingshot ropes instead. Launched little Ernie clean into space on the rebound - it did. Once Ernie splashed down he started selling The Launchpad Bed on the TV. Get yours today before Ernest runs out.</Text>

The stories say the town's early settlers feared the mythic creature, but after saving a group of miners from a mine shaft collapse, he became a town hero! Others say he lurks under the pier and steals churros when Pier goers aren't looking and eats unsuspecting teen's homework around exam time.

The desire to innovate and explore brought him to the valley where Copperdale sits today. After finding rich lines of Copper and Lapis Lazuli throughout the land, Jasper named the city and the lake it is nested on after its most abundant resources. \n\nBut Jasper's life changed when he met something more precious than the ores he had mined for years. A young girl named Tia captured Jasper's heart with one glance. Jasper laid down his pickaxe and settled down with his true love in the hills of Copperdale, looking towards the town's bright future.\n\nWhen his beloved Tia passed, Jasper retired to his home overlooking what is now Prescott square and kept a watchful and loving eye over the town. He lived out his days in peace, but some folks still say they can see Jasper on his porch at the BoomsBluff Mystery House in Prescott Square. </Text>

Founder Jasper Prescott had foraged this land for its treasured crystals, hoping Copperdale would one day blossom into a prosperous community for families and travelers alike. And though the mine carts reached an eternal halt, the townspeople continued to flourish. With academics and adventures abound, Copperdale is now home to many families seeking a small-town life with big-city dreams for themselves and their teens. Together they've unearthed a gem far more precious than before - beloved high school memories.</Text>

  <Text Key="6F04A0B6">{0.SimFirstName} decides the risks are too great and settles back into listening to the guest speaker's incredibly long and incredibly boring speech.</Text>
  <Text Key="43C930E5">Send out social media updates</Text>
  <Text Key="E6DC9F4A">{0.SimFirstName} pulls out {M0.his}{F0.her} phone and starts to browse social media when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears a polite cough. {0.SimFirstName} glances up to find the teacher's gaze locked on {M0.him}{F0.her}! {M0.He}{F0.She} sighs and stuffs {M0.his}{F0.her} phone back into {M0.his}{F0.her} pocket. </Text>
  <Text Key="96092487">{0.SimFirstName} checks {M0.his}{F0.her} phone, posts a quick update, and stuffs it back into {M0.his}{F0.her} pocket just before the teacher's gazes falls on {M0.him}{F0.her}. That was close!</Text>
  <Text Key="2CC5A32A">A guest speaker came into class today to talk about a Teen's future or maybe they were selling some jewelry, {0.SimFirstName} isn't sure. Around the classroom, some students begin to pull out their phones, but the teacher is occasionally glancing at the students. Should {0.SimFirstName} pull out {M0.his}{F0.hers} too?</Text>
  <Text Key="CCFDB9E4">Guest Speaker</Text>
  <Text Key="82DA5150">Stick it Out</Text>
  <Text Key="D6E35D14">{0.SimFirstName} takes a deep breath and remains seated. Despite the cringe-worthy diagrams, the information seemed like it could be useful... someday.</Text>
  <Text Key="A755B788">Faux Faint!</Text>
  <Text Key="865F3E36">{0.SimFirstName} dramatically collapses to the floor! After some gasps, confusion, and minor panic, a classmate helps {0.SimFirstName} back into {M0.his}{F0.her} seat. The teacher, concerned and suspicious, hands {M0.him}{F0.her} some water and then resumes the presentation.</Text>
  <Text Key="04D12054">{0.SimFirstName} collapses to the floor! The teacher rushes to {0.SimFirstName}'s side as classmates cry out. Once {0.SimFirstName} awakens, {M0.he}{F0.she} is sent to get a snack and rest up, successfully missing the rest of the discussions.</Text>
  <Text Key="94FEE9C7">A communal groan stretched across the classroom as reality set in that today was the day health class took over. Most students would have stayed home had they known. Nobody wanted to be here to learn about their bodies! How embarrassing! There aren't many ways to get out of this now, which means {0.SimFirstName} needs to find a way or decide to stick it out. </Text>
  <Text Key="4E7B6545">Health Class</Text>
  <Text Key="4225C374">Tell the Classmate Discreetly </Text>
  <Text Key="19C0A410">{0.SimFirstName} passes a note to {M0.his}{F0.her} classmate that they have a sign on their back. The classmate looks upset but grateful to be told.</Text>
  <Text Key="B4D76574">Make a Scene about the Sign to the Teacher</Text>
  <Text Key="3486A108">{0.SimFirstName} gets the teacher to deal with the Kick Me sign, and things seem to end well. But later in class a note gets passed to {0.SimFirstName} warning {M0.him}{F0.her} to watch out for the bully's repercussions.</Text>
  <Text Key="DD8B6D05">{0.SimFirstName} tells the teacher about the sign and helps get it off. The teacher is thankful and tells {0.SimFirstName} that {M0.he}{F0.she} did the right thing.</Text>
  <Text Key="A1556293">It's almost like Grade School all over again. At some point during class, some of the rougher classmates silently put a "Kick Me" sign on the back of a fellow student. Someone should stand up to those bullies, but should it be today?</Text>
  <Text Key="7160CB21">Kick Me!</Text>
  <Text Key="3A9E61D4">Listen to Announcements</Text>
  <Text Key="61505035">The announcements methodically droned on and on, repetitive and unimportant to anyone listening. One student even dozed off.</Text>
  <Text Key="9A41B034">Surprising everyone, the announcements had some interesting updates for once, and {0.SimFirstName} learned more about {M0.his}{F0.her} fellow classmates. </Text>
  <Text Key="4E8A77D4">Listen to Music</Text>
  <Text Key="1F4142A9">{0.SimFirstName} slides {M0.his}{F0.her} headphones in and begins to jam out. It's unsure if the desk drumming gave it away, but the teacher immediately noticed and cut the concert short. Maybe {0.SimFirstName} can work on being discreet in detention.</Text>
  <Text Key="7F0F01B9">{0.SimFirstName} pops in headphones and subtly jams while the tunes drown out the boring updates and classroom drama.</Text>
  <Text Key="5F80D3F3">The PA loudly chirps on for some announcements. {0.SimFirstName} doesn't really care to hear about the weather forecast or updates to the school's social calendar. With no lessons going on, now seems like a good time to listen to tunes.</Text>
  <Text Key="FA3A0A81">PA Announcements</Text>
  <Text Key="F676C239">Appreciate the Prank on its Own Merit</Text>
  <Text Key="C0397B72">{0.SimFirstName} allows the prank to continue, offering neither praise nor disapproval. The moment passes, the teacher grumbles, and class continues on.</Text>
  <Text Key="4A11C899">Add Personal Sounds to the Speaker Prank</Text>
  <Text Key="A362E397">{0.SimFirstName} stands up and tries to add {M0.his}{F0.her} armpit sounds to the PA noises, but nothing comes out right. {M0.His}{F0.Her} classmates look on, unimpressed and the teacher sighs and tries to refocus the class back on their lessons.</Text>
  <Text Key="C3B0ECCD">{0.SimFirstName} skillfully adds {M0.his}{F0.her} armpit to the sounds coming out of the PA. {M0.His}{F0.Her} fellow classmates get a pretty good laugh out of it.</Text>
  <Text Key="85E244FE">First there was an odd warbling sound coming from the announcement speakers and then a cacophony of very blatant flatulence noises. While those sounds are very immature and far beneath {0.SimFirstName}, {M0.he}{F0.she} can't help but smirk at the predicament, especially with the teacher's response. This could be the time to piggyback off the prank and become a legend among pranksters.</Text>
  <Text Key="59A5B5D8">PA Prank</Text>
  <Text Key="37151650">Add Some Changes</Text>
  <Text Key="21038F0C">{0.SimFirstName} added a few scribbles {M0.he}{F0.she} thought would cause a laugh, but then no one was happy about it. All {0.SimFirstName} got for {M0.his}{F0.her} additions was a little extra irritation from {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates.</Text>
  <Text Key="27BA6B23">{0.SimFirstName} added a few jokes onto the note before passing the note along, causing a few snickers to the people who read it afterwards.</Text>
  <Text Key="5B907C88">Pass the Note Along</Text>
  <Text Key="14BF58F7">{0.SimFirstName} tries to pass the note on but is caught by the teacher with {M0.his}{F0.her} arm outstretched. The teacher stares down menacingly at {0.SimFirstName}, grabs the note, and continues class,</Text>
  <Text Key="E7A0D1AA">{0.SimFirstName} passes the note to the student next to {M0.him}{F0.her} and gets a thumbs up from the classmate who passed {M0.him}{F0.her} the note.</Text>
  <Text Key="31F27EC7">{0.SimFirstName} was about to start dozing off when another student passes {M0.him}{F0.her} a note and points at another student. {0.SimFirstName} didn't even know passing notes was still a thing with social media and phones. Does {0.SimFirstName} continue the note chain or maybe add some changes to the note?</Text>
  <Text Key="ED658245">Passing Notes</Text>
  <Text Key="A0E7F511">No Pencil Throwing Today</Text>

  <Text Key="5F4D4F06">Whoosh! Another classmate tosses a pencil up and it perfectly sticks into the ceiling. Everyone in the class can't seem to pay attention to the board anymore, instead focusing on the pencils hanging above them.

  <Text Key="3CBF0564">The classroom buzzes about {0.SimFirstName}'s take on the school's latest rumor, but out of the corner of {M0.his}{F0.her} eye, {0.SimFirstName} can see the teacher looking over and frowning.</Text>
  <Text Key="562FF9CD">No one believes {0.SimFirstName}'s wild story could possibly be true. {0.SimFirstName} withdraws sheepishly, trying not to make a bigger fool out of {M0.himself}{F0.herself}.</Text>
  <Text Key="C075F999">It started as a simple whisper among the other students in class, but now it has grown far more intricate. Someone's mom's cousin's kid did something or other after school. No one can keep the story straight. When a classmate asks {0.SimFirstName} what {M0.he}{F0.she} knows about the subject, should {M0.he}{F0.she} keep spreading the rumor or stop it in its tracks?</Text>

  <Text Key="0AC685B3">{0.SimFirstName} decides to rock it! The outfit gives off an artsy post-apocalyptic vibe with the clumps of clay and dust trails. Could this be the next big trend?</Text>
  <Text Key="8F6C8768">{0.SimFirstName} isn't thrilled with the decision to embrace {M0.his}{F0.her} disastrous look. The mess starts to crust over and smell terrible as time goes on. Turns out being covered in clay is only cute in the movies.</Text>

  <Text Key="0009193D">{0.SimFirstName} spends time scrubbing away at {M0.his}{F0.her} outfit. Unfortunately, the teacher notices {M0.him}{F0.her} neglecting {M0.his}{F0.her} work to save the clothes and docks {M0.him}{F0.her} points on the assignment.</Text>
  <Text Key="D5C9EA2D">{0.SimFirstName} grabbed a sponge and began scrubbing. {M0.He}{F0.She} manages to get all the gunk out without anyone noticing {M0.his}{F0.her} absence. Once dry, {M0.his}{F0.her} outfit is good as new!</Text>
  <Text Key="5403885F">The hit movie "Spirit", starring Patwick Swazzy, did not prepare {0.SimFirstName} enough for this class. Between the clay whipping round and round, and the glaze clumping to every surface, {M0.his}{F0.her} pottery is looking more like a soupy mess. To top it off, {0.SimFirstName}'s outfit has been completely ruined. Scrubbing the stains will take time but the alternative is to leave class a mess.</Text>

  <Text Key="9302D32C">It's no use! Try as {M0.he}{F0.she} might, there's just no way {0.SimFirstName} can keep {M0.his}{F0.her} brain focused on learning these colors. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn't feel confident going into the next exam.</Text>
  <Text Key="AD02853A">{0.SimFirstName} decides the straight and narrow is the best path. {M0.He}{F0.She} pays close attention during class, writes down clear and easy to study notes, and generally does {M0.his}{F0.her} best to prepare for the next exam.</Text>
  <Text Key="4A9E7087">Make a cheat sheet</Text>

  <Text Key="88D972A9">{0.SimFirstName} jots down a few notes onto a small card and hides it inside {M0.his}{F0.her} desk without anyone noticing. Now {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll have easy access to it on the next exam.</Text>
  <Text Key="6EBC5548">And here {0.SimFirstName} just thought there were only primary and secondary colors. Now suddenly there are 7 different color schemes, a wheel, and some associated values. Art was supposed to be the easy class, but now there is just so much to memorize that {0.SimFirstName} doesn't know if {M0.he}{F0.she} will ever be ready to test on this. Unless {M0.he}{F0.she} makes a Cheat Sheet.</Text>

  <Text Key="537052D5">{0.SimFirstName} begins slapping together bits of spaghetti and hot glue with zero game plan. After a whirlwind of creativity and flavor, it ultimately ends in a disastrous collapse. It seems using cooked spaghetti may not have been the best idea.</Text>
  <Text Key="66C054AD">Strategic Moves Only</Text>
  <Text Key="8B0AB05F">Only a spaghetti master could form such an architectural miracle! {0.SimFirstName}'s tower stood tall and firm as the teacher placed weights upon it. Who knew spaghetti was so strong!?</Text>
  <Text Key="D920D960">{0.SimFirstName} thought it would be a brilliant idea to hide the weights. No weights mean no tower test! The teacher, however, was less impressed with that notion. They were also less impressed with the attempted heist. Next time, do the project.</Text>
  <Text Key="585C00B2">No one said working with hot glue and spaghetti would be easy. But today is the day! {0.SimFirstName} must put {M0.his}{F0.her} art skills to the test and build a tower out of delicious carbs and craft store adhesive. There's a catch, of course. The structure must withstand a weight placed on top! With such a challenge, would strategy be best, or just winging it?</Text>
  <Text Key="A1BA388C">Spaghetti Towers</Text>
  <Text Key="4F599119">Stay Awake</Text>
  <Text Key="1BB945FD">{0.SimFirstName} fights the droopiness in {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes to keep {M0.himself}{F0.herself} awake. It's a struggle, but {M0.he}{F0.she} does manage to make it through class.</Text>
  <Text Key="E31B12F9">Nap Away!</Text>
  <Text Key="B6825234">{0.SimFirstName} drifts off only to be startled awake by a tap on the shoulder. The teacher is looming over {M0.him}{F0.her} with an exasperated look. Napping during class didn't go unnoticed, especially with such loud snoring. </Text>
  <Text Key="7074951C">{0.SimFirstName} curls up at her desk and drifts off to sleep. Becoming a still-life {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to squeeze in a quality nap before the bell rings.</Text>
  <Text Key="F6F843DE">With the lights turned down for still life drawings, drowsiness sets in. {0.SimFirstName} can't resist dozing off while staring at unmoving objects, trying to capture their shape. It's unlikely the teacher will notice if {0.SimFirstName} just takes a quick nap, right?  </Text>
  <Text Key="80E400B8">Still Life</Text>
  <Text Key="AE10C9FD">Might still learn something from the book</Text>
  <Text Key="224F39B7">No matter how {0.SimFirstName} tries to read between the lines, this book is nothing but a self-congratulatory vanity project of some rich jerk.</Text>
  <Text Key="0D503F65">Give a piece of teenage insight</Text>
  <Text Key="1922D3D9">The teacher frowns and asks if {0.SimFirstName} was so smart, why doesn't {M0.he}{F0.she} already have a successful business like the author did at {M0.his}{F0.her} age.</Text>
  <Text Key="8C3F4BB6">The teacher agrees and compliments {0.SimFirstName} for {M0.his}{F0.her} insight. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she}'s got a future in this field!</Text>
  <Text Key="58F1D9AA">The class is going over some business advice book written by some rich Sim and something just doesn't seem right. All the advice appears to be how to get rich when already rich. Maybe it's time to let the teacher know what {0.SimFirstName} thinks of this book.</Text>
  <Text Key="6A191464">The Art of the "Business"</Text>
  <Text Key="133FE1B3">Make a funny brand</Text>
  <Text Key="C5AB91D1">{0.SimFirstName} is greeted by a little bit of confusion and lot of yawning when as {M0.he}{F0.she} presents {M0.his}{F0.her} brand idea. Maybe {M0.his}{F0.her} humor calibration was a bit off.</Text>
  <Text Key="C9421386">Sometimes all a brand needs is good humor surrounding it, and {0.SimFirstName} seems to have struck a lot of praise for {M0.his}{F0.her} comedic brand.</Text>
  <Text Key="B1BA8613">Take the assignment seriously</Text>
  <Text Key="2282CB57">No matter how {0.SimFirstName} tries to read between the lines, this book is nothing but a self-congratulatory vanity project of some rich jerk.</Text>
  <Text Key="33E6AC67">No one is taking the brand {0.SimFirstName} put together seriously, even though {M0.he}{F0.she} put a lot of work into it. Effort doesn't always yield results, I guess.</Text>
  <Text Key="B2BAFDA4">One of the most important part of marketing something is how it's branded, at least according to the teacher in class today. Part of the in class assignment is to make an original brand and present it to the class. {0.SimFirstName} figures this could go one of two ways, either try a serious brand or make it a complete joke.</Text>
  <Text Key="D0DCD662">Branding</Text>
  <Text Key="A1C32E89">Stock Market</Text>
  <Text Key="EBE3E990">While a risky investment is appreciated, {0.SimFirstName} forgets to account for a total market crash in {M0.his}{F0.her} answer.</Text>
  <Text Key="4D6F192D">{0.SimFirstName} scribbles down a plan to invest in stocks, hoping it's high-risk with high rewards. The teacher is impressed with {0.SimFirstName}'s work as it gives attention to risk-return tradeoff assessments. In other words, good job!</Text>
  <Text Key="EBC05189">Simoleon Savings</Text>
  <Text Key="B5C58F6C">{0.SimFirstName} begins to write down a more private investment plan, a savings account. Seeing this over {M0.his}{F0.her} shoulder, the teacher notes that it's not a risky enough answer. Think bigger! </Text>
  <Text Key="B1D7E014">{0.SimFirstName} confidently writes down {M0.his}{F0.her} personal investment plan. Despite the small interest rates, a savings account is still an investment. And it's one the teacher approves of!</Text>
  <Text Key="E54DDC6E">Investing can be tricky, and risk is almost always involved. {0.SimFirstName} needs to decide how to invest a sum of Simoleons in order to pass {M0.his}{F0.her} assignment. What's the best course of action?</Text>

  <Text Key="F2FEBBBB">{0.SimFirstName}'s suggestion falls a bit flat. The teacher commends {M0.him}{F0.her} for {M0.his}{F0.her} realness, but {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates think {M0.he}{F0.she} ruined the vibe. </Text>
  <Text Key="AA667E3E">The whole class cheered as the teacher presented notorious Startup trends like bean bag chairs and epic snacks. Nothing says "cool workplace vibes" like a ping pong table.

  <Text Key="ABF100C5">Sandcastle!</Text>
  <Text Key="659F7022">{0.SimFirstName} spends more time trying to replicate sand than {M0.he}{F0.she} does making the castle. With nothing to show in the end, {M0.his}{F0.her} project is deemed a flop.</Text>

  <Text Key="B47B287D">Computer Noodle!</Text>
  <Text Key="20C04436">{0.SimFirstName} immediately starts crafting a digital noodle. It folds and unfolds like a technical work of art, impressing everyone. Who knew pasta could be so complex!</Text>
  <Text Key="934BDBA2">The teacher is not exactly thrilled by a curved cylinder that took two minutes to make. It's important for {0.SimFirstName} to try harder next time.</Text>
  <Text Key="0CE11B82">Technical drawings seem insanely advanced in the world of 3D media. {0.SimFirstName} misses the days when macaroni art or sandcastles sufficed as 3D designs. Would a macaroni noodle work as a project idea? Maybe a sandcastle?</Text>

  <Text Key="C7A3AFED">{0.SimFirstName} saw {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher's relief over {M0.his}{F0.her} decision to follow the rules. Getting on the teacher's good side can have perks too.</Text>
  <Text Key="159EB953">Unfortunately, {0.SimFirstName} wasn't as careful as {M0.he}{F0.she} thought when removing the blockers. {M0.his}{F0.Her} shenanigans let a virus in, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} will have to spend detention wondering where {M0.he}{F0.she} went wrong. </Text>
  <Text Key="F8951AFB">The teacher might be happy, but the students are not. {0.SimFirstName}'s promise goes undelivered, and the cute cats remain unseen.</Text>
  <Text Key="4FD721B8">The school set up safety blockers on web pages to keep students from getting distracted or downloading viruses. Unfortunately, this means {0.SimFirstName} can't pull up the funny cat video {M0.he}{F0.she} wanted to show the class.

  <Text Key="AC54D548">Leave the silence hanging</Text>

  <Text Key="4F90DAEF">{0.SimFirstName} isn't inclined to stick {M0.his}{F0.her} neck out for the teacher's strange joke. The silence hangs in the air for a bit, the teacher grimaces, and class continues.</Text>
  <Text Key="5861403E">The teacher decided to appeal to students with a very cringeworthy meme.

  <Text Key="533FB969">The teacher is claiming that students need to have 60 words per minute while typing to pass the class. {0.SimFirstName} doesn't even know why that's relevant, everything is done on the phone now anyway.

The team decided to work on developing a freezer bunny augmented reality face filter for sims to try on their phones. It was a highly ambitious idea, given the short timeframe they had to complete the project. Each team member had worked on a piece of this application during practice but they did not cohesively put together a final product . As time began to run out, it was up to {0.SimFirstName} to complete the project with adding the correct art asset to the face detection tracker. As {M0.he}{F0.she} was finishing up the code, the judges called for all coding to STOP. Now it was time for the judge to try the tech...It did trigger the activation but it was definitely not the freezer bunny art asset....the judges head was turned into a giant poop swirl with a talking mouth. How embarrassing! Copperdale did not win the hackathon.  </Text>

There was not anything like it and the team was jazzed about creating it.

When it came time to present the app outcome, the Copperdale computer team was able to pull off the cutest face filter! The judge even tried it themselves, showing off the freezer bunny face filter that even blinked when you did! The cuteness won over the judging panel, making {0.SimFirstName}'s tech the winner! </Text>

The play goes just as planned. The opposing team falls for the play fake and {0.SimFirstName} is wide open. The quarterback throws an accurate pass and {0.SimFirstName} catches the football successfully. {0.SimFirstName} notices a rare opportunity in the open field and a chance to score the game winning touchdown.

  <Text Key="7F60E505">Mistakes have been made, as {0.SimFirstName}’s movements offset the momentum of the already teetering carriage. Unprepared, both riders are flung from their seats. {0.SimFirstName} tries to brace for the impact while still looking cool but fails miserably, knocking {F0.her}{M0.his} head against the window of the carriage. {F0.She}{M0.He} fumbles out of the carriage in a daze, nursing a headache and a hurt ego.</Text>
  <Text Key="1648439F">Whether it’s the messing around or the air time, the two riders' hearts pitter patter as the carriage rocks back and forth.

  <Text Key="E8CB2038">Maybe {0.SimFirstName} should have slowed down a little bit. The rocking becomes too much, and {F0.her}{M0.his} unsettled stomach reaches its limit. The carriage is filled with the remnants of the last meal {F0.she}{M0.he} ate. Needless to say, this killed the mood a little bit. The ride to the bottom is uncomfortable and pungent.

Once {0.SimFirstName} realizes this is a prank, {F0.she}{M0.he} hides {F0.her}{M0.his} head in embarrassment.</Text>

  <Text Key="9AC05116">{0.SimFirstName} can tell that {1.SimFirstName} doesn’t feel like opening up right now, so distraction it is! {F0.She}{M0.He} begins to tell the story of two childhood sweethearts that carved their initials at the top of the rock side near Copperdale High. No one knows who the couple is but they say every now and again students will find remnants of a picnic left beside the romantic rock. {1.SimFirstName} smiles at the sweet story of the littering love birds and the heavy atmosphere in the carriage lifts.</Text>

All the other riders in nearby carts turn and look at the cowering {0.SimFirstName}. As the two exit, an attendant is hanging up a photo of a mid-scream {0.SimFirstName} for all Pier visitors to see. The flashing light had been a new feature the park was testing and {0.SimFirstName} was unlucky enough to have been caught up in the experiment. An unfortunate end to an already uncomfortable ride.</Text>

  <Text Key="2FDD04E6">The time to be the hero is now! {0.SimFirstName} pushes down the fear and begins looking around the cart for what could have made the noise. As {0.SimFirstName} is looking the cart leans a little to one side and a shrill squeak comes from the wheels.

  <Text Key="DBC5A92E">{0.SimFirstName} puts on {F0.her}{M0.his} brave pants and gazes into the darkness, attempting to find what could have made such a noise. {F0.She}{M0.He} shines {F0.her}{M0.his} phone light but finds nothing but spit out gum and twisted cords.

Trust and a whole bunch of kisses and hugs.</Text>

As they exit and try to shake fear off, {0.SimFirstName} mentions to the ride attendant how scary that new scream was. The attendant looks at {0.SimFirstName} with a confused expression.\n\n“What new scream?”</Text>
  <Text Key="ADA0C173">Setting the mood for some messing around is easy when you have the Grave Mine. The carts are small, the lights are low, and music rings through the air. Sure, it's creepy organ music, but it's still music. {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} are vibing with Forgotten Hollow's Spookiest Bops when a bloodcurdling scream echoes throughout the room, focused on a point strangely close to their cart.\n\nNo other riders are in the room, and {0.SimFirstName} doesn't remember a scream during this part of the ride. It is probably just a new track, right? Does {0.SimFirstName} pay no mind and assure {1.SimFirstName} that the scream was just a new part of the ride? Or does {F0.she}{M0.he} investigate and see if {F0.she}{M0.he} finds the source of the noise.</Text>

When {F0.she}{M0.he} looks back up, the animatronic is gone. \n\nChills run down {0.SimFirstName}’s spine and {F0.she}{M0.he} breathes a sigh of relief when {F0.she}{M0.he} reaches the light of the exit. When {F0.she}{M0.he} looks back {F0.she}{M0.he} swears {F0.she}{M0.he} can see someone waving to {F0.her}{M0.him} in the dark. {F0.She}{M0.He} tentatively waves back and exits the ride; the animatronic’s “gift” clutched in {F0.her}{M0.his} hand.</Text>

The moment {F0.she}{M0.he} grasps the animtronic’s hand, it grasps back and {0.SimFirstName} is pulled from the mine cart. {F0.She}{M0.He} screams and everything goes black.\n\nNext thing {0.SimFirstName} knows, {F0.she}{M0.he} is sitting back in the cart and is nearing the tunnel exit. {F0.She}{M0.He} shakes {F0.her}{M0.his} head, unsure of what happened. One thing {0.SimFirstName} does know is that {F0.she}{M0.he} is in need of a change of pants.</Text>

  <Text Key="5D72D4A0">{0.SimFirstName} decides to stay put but keeps eye contact with the animatronic a few seconds too long. {F0.She}{M0.He} quickly turns away but it is too late.

  <Text Key="5AAAA38B">{0.SimFirstName} decides to play it safe and keep {F0.her}{M0.his} arms and legs inside the ride, as previously instructed. {F0.She}{M0.He} breaks eye contact and sinks down into the mine cart as far as {F0.she}{M0.he} can. The creaking sounds of the animatronic slowly come closer to the cart, picking up the pace with each exhale of {0.SimFirstName}’s breath. In {0.SimFirstName}’s ear a gentle voice whispers: "Bring me a churro next time"\n\n{F0.She}{M0.He} turns around quickly but finds nothing but the dark tunnel behind {F0.her}{M0.him}. When {F0.she}{M0.he} turns back in the cart, {F0.her}{M0.his} hand brushes against something in the seat. Someone or something has left {0.SimFirstName} a gift. Whether this was a threat or a bribe, {0.SimFirstName} may never know. What {F0.she}{M0.he} does know is that whatever creature lurks within The Grave Mine has a sweet tooth.</Text>
  <Text Key="A1B1CD21">To ride The Grave Mine alone and survive is a badge of honor. One that {0.SimFirstName} is reluctantly trying to earn. Suddenly, the mine cart lurches to a halt. An attendant calls over the intercom that the ride will resume shortly and to stay in the cart. The silence overtakes the room, besides the clicking of the animatronics moving in the dark.\n\nOne animatronic in particular stands still, reaching out and staring {0.SimFirstName} straight in the eyes.

The ride operator apologizes for the inconvenience and offers some Simoleons as compensation.</Text>
  <Text Key="C692BDFD">{0.SimFirstName} jumps out of the cart, screaming in fear, but wanders a little bit too far away from the cart and gets lost. {F0.She}{M0.He} spends most of {F0.her}{M0.his} time feeling around the dark walls, attempting to find the exit. {0.SimFirstName} finally makes {F0.her}{M0.his} way to the exit where the deserted {1.SimFirstName} is waiting. {0.SimFirstName} is exhausted and embarrassed as {F0.she}{M0.he} is teased relentlessly for {F0.her}{M0.his} failed escape attempt.</Text>
  <Text Key="8A560902">Fight</Text>
  <Text Key="33A1F81B">With a scream, {0.SimFirstName} throws one heck of a punch towards the general direction of whatever is lurking in the dark. {1.SimFirstName} ducks out of the way at the perfect time and {0.SimFirstName} lands a nice jab straight into the face of someone that has snuck into the ride to scare unsuspecting riders. The prankster groans and retreats. {0.SimFirstName} spends the rest of the ride laughing, nursing a sore hand, and basking in the pride of protecting {F0.her}{M0.his} fellow rider.</Text>
  <Text Key="9DB49063">{0.SimFirstName} closes {F0.her}{M0.his} eyes and instinctively goes into ‘fight’ mode. {F0.She}{M0.He} throws a haphazard punch into the darkness. {F0.her}{M0.his} hand makes contact with a crack and {F0.she}{M0.he} lets out a shout of triumph at protecting {F0.her}{M0.his} fellow rider. {0.SimFirstName} hears {1.SimFirstName} groan and reel backwards in pain. {0.SimFirstName} apologizes profusely but the damage is done. {F0.She}{M0.He} finishes the ride in embarrassed silence, feeling guilty for the accidental, and strangely accurate, punch.</Text>

  <Text Key="CC38D801">{0.SimFirstName} gets a response from an overzealous Plumbite Pier expert berating {F0.her}{M0.him} for {F0.her}{M0.his} innacuracies in {F0.her}{M0.his} post. The bickering has taken what little fun {0.SimFirstName} was having and puts {F0.her}{M0.him} in a bad mood.</Text>
  <Text Key="72B5BEAE">{0.SimFirstName}’s post turns out to be more popular than {F0.she}{M0.he} anticipated and {F0.she}{M0.he} is bombarded with messages from Plumbite Pier experts arguing over tiny details of the ride's history. The comments are interesting at first, but by the time {F0.she}{M0.he} gets through them all, {F0.she}{M0.he} is lulled to sleep by the darkness and boring reading. At least {F0.she}{M0.he} got a good nap.</Text>
  <Text Key="9353D4E1">Flirty</Text>
  <Text Key="5D0B1E34">{0.SimFirstName} is delighted when someone actually slides into {F0.her}{M0.his} dms and strikes up a conversation. A really **good** conversation, at that. {F0.She}{M0.He} focuses {F0.her}{M0.his} attention on the flirty messages and completely forgot {F0.she}{M0.he} is riding alone.</Text>
  <Text Key="89028C6B">{0.SimFirstName} gets a response but rather than a potential partner, it's from a distant relative complaining about the indecency of {F0.her}{M0.his} post. The rage and disappointment thrown {0.SimFirstName}’s way puts {F0.her}{M0.him} in an even worse mood.</Text>
  <Text Key="9D38A242">The Cuddle Carts aren't very cuddly when riding solo. The ride comes to a halt, and a voice on the intercom informs the riders that the ride will begin again shortly. Now, not only is {0.SimFirstName} alone, but {F0.she}{M0.he} is alone in the dark. {F0.She}{M0.He} pulls out {F0.her}{M0.his} phone to post to {F0.her}{M0.his} Social Bunny while {F0.she}{M0.he} waits. Does {F0.she}{M0.he} post something flirty to try and attract a cuddly companion? Or post a random fact about the Cuddle Carts to strike up a conversation?</Text>
  <Text Key="95D09B5C">Fade into Darkness</Text>
  <Text Key="F60FDD0B">Introduce Yourself</Text>
  <Text Key="28037FE7">A voice responds from the cart ahead of {0.SimFirstName} waving happily. The fellow single rider strikes up a conversation and tries to make the ride a little less lonely for the both of them. It turns out to be a rousing success! The lively conversation made the time go quickly, and {0.SimFirstName} forgot {F0.she}{M0.he} was riding alone.\n\nThe kind conversationalist exits the ride first, before {0.SimFirstName} can get the mysterious rider's name. Whoever it was, they were a kind soul that made the ride memorable for a much happier reason than being alone.</Text>
  <Text Key="98131105">The air grows colder and the figure of an old miner appears right next to {0.SimFirstName}. {F0.She}{M0.He} recognizes the miner from the statue in Prescott Square as Ol' Jasper Prescott, the original prospector and founder of the town. Jasper places a hand on {0.SimFirstName}’s shoulder and gives an encouraging nod.\n\n"You'll find someone. If an ol’ coot like me can find love, so can you."\n\nBefore {F0.she}{M0.he} can respond, {0.SimFirstName} feels the presence disappear, leaving nothing but {0.SimFirstName} with a sense of confusion, comfort, and fear simultaneously. While the message was comforting, {F0.she}{M0.he} can still feel that cold air on the back of {F0.her}{M0.his} neck.</Text>
  <Text Key="701BD330">Wait it Out</Text>
  <Text Key="6C8AEAEB">{0.SimFirstName} decides to ignore the feeling and try to continue enjoying the ride solo. Unfortunately, the couple in the cart behind {F0.her}{M0.him} is being a little to enthusiastic in making the Cuddle Carts live up to its name. {F0.She}{M0.He} covers {F0.her}{M0.his} ears and tries to drown out the sound. It’s a noisy, uncomfortable ride and not just because {F0.she}{M0.he} had to ride by {M0.himself}{F0.herself}.</Text>
  <Text Key="B62F016B">{0.SimFirstName} shakes off the cold feeling and puts on a brave face. The cold air subsides as a worker appears nearby {0.SimFirstName}’s cart. The worker explains that there were too many complaints about the room being too hot for maximum cuddle potential and was tasked with setting up some fans to try to air out the room. \n\nThe worker notices {0.SimFirstName} is alone and gives {F0.her}{M0.him} a playful wink and waves as {F0.her}{M0.his} cart enters the next room. This helps soothe {0.SimFirstName}’s pride, and {F0.she}{M0.he} feels a little more confident after the friendly exchange. Maybe next time {F0.she}{M0.he} will bring a companion, and the Cuddle Carts will actually live up to the name.</Text>
  <Text Key="4ABAD1A7">Riding solo on the Cuddle Carts can be somewhat disheartening. Will {0.SimFirstName} ever find a snuggly partner to ride with {F0.her}{M0.him}? Before {0.SimFirstName} can feel too bad about {F0.herself}{M0.himself}, the room goes cold, and {F0.she}{M0.he} feels like {F0.she}{M0.he} is no longer alone. A breath on {F0.her}{M0.his} neck, a chill in {F0.her}{M0.his} spine, does {F0.she}{M0.he} address the presence {F0.she}{M0.he} is feeling? Or does {F0.she}{M0.he} pretend not to feel anything and wait for the ride to continue?</Text>
  <Text Key="1BD2D125">Hello?</Text>
  <Text Key="B65D3E7E">Lean Into the Atmosphere</Text>
  <Text Key="CDCEA6FD">It's cheesy, sure. But it's adorable and {0.SimFirstName} can see that {1.SimFirstName} is enjoying the ride. That's enough to encourage {0.SimFirstName} to go all in. The rest of the ride {0.SimFirstName} puts on the performance of a lifetime in perfect sync with the ride's over-the-top exhibits. \n\n{1.SimFirstName} wipes tears from {F1.her}{M1.his} eyes from laughter and loves that {0.SimFirstName} is playing along with the classic ride. This playful side of {0.SimFirstName} couldn't be more attractive to {1.SimFirstName}. The sound of giggles from that Cuddle Cart put the rest of the ride's lovey-dovey displays to shame.</Text>
  <Text Key="D040C4F3">Something awakens within {0.SimFirstName}, and the cheese is starting to spoil with the over-exuberance of {F0.her}{M0.his} performance. {1.SimFirstName} was excited at first, but the interpretive dance (for lack of a better term) that {0.SimFirstName} was attempting completely ruined the mood.\n\nUnfortunately, {0.SimFirstName} was too far gone, and the Cuddle Carts have created a monster. A singing, dancing monster that isn't nearly as cute as it sounds. {0.SimFirstName} thinks the ride went great and is ready to keep the flirty vibes going without realizing that {1.SimFirstName} has already started to block out the ride from {F1.her}{M1.his} memory.</Text>
  <Text Key="FBE46C29">Joke About Ride</Text>
  <Text Key="21B4333D">{0.SimFirstName} decides to poke a little fun at the ride, throwing in some flirty bits to try and steer the conversation in a more romantic direction. {1.SimFirstName} is all for it and adds a few quips of {F1.her}{M1.his} own. The two banter back and forth with flirty remarks, and the ride turns out to be a little less cheesy and a lot more steamy. Few things are more attractive than a great sense of humor.</Text>
  <Text Key="64B4C14D">The quips that come out of {0.SimFirstName}'s mouth turn out to be too much for {1.SimFirstName}. This ride is a classic, and {1.SimFirstName} is offended at {0.SimFirstName}'s disrespect to its legacy. The Cuddle Carts may be a silly, cheesy ride, but it is an important part of the town's history. {0.SimFirstName} apologizes and goes back to listening to the serenade of Frank the Flying Womp Womp to try and distract from the awkward atmosphere between {F0.her}{M0.him} and {1.SimFirstName}.</Text>
  <Text Key="CE36EACA">{0.SimFirstName} wanted to make the perfect romantic atmosphere and thought the Cuddle Carts would be the best way. What {F0.she}{M0.he} wasn’t expecting was just how cheesy the ride would be, which isn't exactly the vibe {F0.she}{M0.he} was going for. {F0.She}{M0.He} looks at {1.SimFirstName} and tries to gauge {F1.her}{M1.his} reaction. {F0.She}{M0.He} can't tell if {F1.she}{M1.he} is into the corny atmosphere or not.\n\nDoes {0.SimFirstName} poke fun at the ride and add some flirty banter to try and make the moment a little more romantic? Or does {F0.she}{M0.he} embrace the cheese and attempt to show {1.SimFirstName} a slice of playfulness?</Text>
  <Text Key="287CFD04">Corny Jail</Text>
  <Text Key="F9C5DF93">Pull Away</Text>
  <Text Key="2F3C5B78">As {0.SimFirstName} pulls away, {F0.she}{M0.he} asks that the ride be a little less snuggly from this point on. {1.SimFirstName} agrees and gives {0.SimFirstName} space, but {F0.she}{M0.he} can see that {1.SimFirstName} is a little disappointed at the response. {0.SimFirstName} feels a little guilty but {F0.she}{M0.he} is glad that {F0.she}{M0.he} said something before things got carried away. Maybe the Cuddle Carts should wait until both are ready to take the next step.</Text>
  <Text Key="F48F1149">{0.SimFirstName} let {1.SimFirstName} know how {F0.she}{M0.he} is feeling and that {F0.she}{M0.he} would like to slow down. {1.SimFirstName} understands completely and the ride ends with a comfortable understanding of boundaries. Communication is key!</Text>
  <Text Key="FCF5AB78">Go for a Kiss</Text>
  <Text Key="203F9D30">When {0.SimFirstName} leans in closer {1.SimFirstName} stretches {F1.her}{M1.his} arms above {F1.her}{M1.his} head and yawns. {F1.She}{M1.He} apologizes for falling asleep. {0.SimFirstName} can’t help but be a little disappointed at the revelation that {1.SimFirstName} just needed more sleep and didn’t want a kiss. {F0.She}{M0.He} offers {F0.her}{M0.his} shoulder if {F1.she}{M1.he} wants to take another snooze. {F1.She}{M1.He} accepts, and the two spend a pleasant and, sadly for {0.SimFirstName}, friendly ride through the Cuddle Carts.</Text>
  <Text Key="97AF19EE">{0.SimFirstName} decides the risk is worth it and closes the gap between the potentially expectant {1.SimFirstName}. Success! {1.SimFirstName} was definitely thinking the same thing and the two have a lovely kiss that could potentially be the start of something really special.</Text>
  <Text Key="B79F552F">{0.SimFirstName} had anticipated the Cuddle Carts to be romantic, but he didn’t realize the effect it would have on {1.SimFirstName}. With flushed cheeks and a coy smile, {1.SimFirstName} looks like {F1.she}{M1.he} might want to take the next step into a relationship. {F1.She}{M1.He} closes {F1.her}{M1.his} eyes and leans towards {0.SimFirstName}. \n\nCould it be that {1.SimFirstName} is leaning in for smooch? Or is {F1.she}{M1.he} just resting {F1.her}{M1.his} eyes as a reprieve from all the sights and sounds of the attraction? {0.SimFirstName} has to make a choice. Does {F0.she}{M0.he} commit and meet {1.SimFirstName} halfway? Or does {F0.she}{M0.he} pull away and try to deescalate the situation?</Text>
  <Text Key="641CADCD">Hopeless Romantic</Text>
  <Text Key="017CBAE4">Ask to be Friends</Text>
  <Text Key="76F35378">{0.SimFirstName} tells {1.SimFirstName} how much {F0.she}{M0.he} values {F1.her}{M1.him} as a friend, and hopes the romantic nature of the ride hasn't made things awkward for the two. Luckily, {1.SimFirstName} was feeling the same and the two let out a sigh of relief at the assurance there wasn't a misunderstanding. For the duration of the ride, the two turn the Cuddle Carts into the Comradery Carts and become closer as friends.</Text>
  <Text Key="070D7D56">{0.SimFirstName} lets {1.SimFirstName} know that {F0.she}{M0.he} wants to remain friends and is hoping {1.SimFirstName} wasn't harboring any feelings for {F0.her}{M0.him}. {1.SimFirstName} laughs it off and assures {0.SimFirstName} that any feelings {F1.she}{M1.he} has for {0.SimFirstName} is platonic. {0.SimFirstName} feels better for a moment but sees a bit of sadness behind {0.SimFirstName}'s eyes. The power of the Cuddle Carts was not strong enough to sway any hearts today.</Text>
  <Text Key="1B5B6593">Keep Flirting</Text>
  <Text Key="42B6BAD5">Nothing says "I want to be more than friends" than being stuck on a ride with someone while you're serenaded by the smooth sounds of Frank the Flying Womp Womp. The two flirt for the entire ride, keeping within respectful boundaries, but also not backing down.\n\nNothing &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; exciting happened but something has sparked within {1.SimFirstName}’s heart that could be the perfect opportunity for {0.SimFirstName} to pursue a relationship. Will they or won't they? Maybe you'll find out in Cuddle Carts: The Sequel.</Text>
  <Text Key="2FDB1D25">{0.SimFirstName} scoots a little closer and gives {1.SimFirstName} a flirty wink. {1.SimFirstName} starts laughing and gives {0.SimFirstName}'s shoulder a playful smack. What a great joke! {0.SimFirstName}’s flirting has gone completely over {1.SimFirstName}’s head and the two finish the ride out with friendly conversation. It may not be the outcome that {0.SimFirstName} was expecting, but at least the two have grown closer in some way.</Text>
  <Text Key="BE98127C">{0.SimFirstName} has decided {F0.she}{M0.he} wants to talk to {1.SimFirstName} about their relationship, and what better way to communicate a serious relationship than through a cheesy Plumbite Peir attraction! \n\nIs that twinkle in {1.SimFirstName}’s eye a hint of attraction or irritation from the atmospheric fog being pumped into the room? Does {F0.she}{M0.he} try out the smolder and attempt to win {1.SimFirstName} over? Or does {F0.she}{M0.he} try and de-escalate the romance and encourage a stronger friendship? </Text>
  <Text Key="CC8040DA">Just Friends</Text>
  <Text Key="8901FC9F">Try Some Rhymes</Text>
  <Text Key="D454E454">Roses are red. The cuddle cart too. {0.SimFirstName}’s rhymes are so bad, {1.SimFirstName} wants to go home. Maybe {0.SimFirstName} should have just left the romantic mood to the Cuddle Carts.</Text>
  <Text Key="BDDEF312">{0.SimFirstName} would like {1.SimFirstName} to know that {F1.she}{M1.he} has bewitched {F0.her}{M0.him}, body and soul, and never wishes to be parted from {F1.her}{M1.him} for the rest of the ride. The beautiful words have {1.SimFirstName} swooning and {F1.she}{M1.he} can't wait to say how ardently {F1.she}{M1.he} admires {F0.her}{M0.him} back. The wooing has been successful! They do say poetry is the food of love.</Text>
  <Text Key="8DC139C4">Ride the Vibes</Text>
  <Text Key="01156CC6">It turns out vibes aren't that fun to ride. The Cuddle Carts prove to be a little too turbulent for any canoodling, and the two spend the ride trying to hold on for dear life rather than each other. Not only that, the loud squeaking and clanging have drawn too much attention for {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} to keep a low profile. Don't you hate it when you pick the squeaky cart?</Text>
  <Text Key="60666A8A">To no one’s surprise, the Cuddle Carts are the perfect place to enjoy the warmth of a special someone’s embrace. The greatest thing {0.SimFirstName} has ever learned is to cuddle and be cuddled in return, so when the mood takes over, {F0.she}{M0.he} knows exactly what to do. {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} do a little more than cuddle in the cart and make a pleasant memory that neither will forget. </Text>
  <Text Key="56C94803">{0.SimFirstName} can feel the love tonight and is ready to take this cuddle cart to the next level. The light cascading across the face of {1.SimFirstName} creates an image so breathtaking, {F0.she}{M0.he} is taken aback. The stunning sight has given {0.SimFirstName} some inspiration to write some prose about such beauty. Does {0.SimFirstName} attempt to make the mood even more romantic by reciting some personalized poetry? Or does {F0.she}{M0.he} let his actions do the talking?</Text>
  <Text Key="5049DC91">Perfect Conditions</Text>

  <Text Key="4208AAE3">{0.SimFirstName} does pretty well during practice but having to switch last minute to a new position is not really enough time to prepare for such action. While being tossed by the fellow teammates, {0.SimFirstName} was caught successfully but then jumped down too soon, leaving {M0.him}{F0.her} with a minor injury.  </Text>
  <Text Key="02705AD2">{0.SimFirstName} decides their limbs are worth more than that, so the team decides to skip the toss moves. The whole team is out of practice for the major moves for the day. </Text>
  <Text Key="A3AFF2B0">What a catch! {0.SimFirstName} went from front lunge to making the perfect catch. A rival Sim from the Football team saw that amazing move and is asking if you want to join the team.</Text>
  <Text Key="5EF86015">{0.SimFirstName} has great reflexes and was able to jump out of the way, avoiding a bonk on the head. The move was a good addition to practice today, the team might even work something like that into the cheer routine.</Text>

  <Text Key="62B52C2D">The Anti-Gnome move was all about the defense. This may work in some cases where high skill and practice can defend enough to block the gambit but {0.SimFirstName} was a bit too slow, causing the other players to successfully win the game.  </Text>
  <Text Key="C0C6D3BE">The Anti-Gnome move was all about the defense. This may work in some cases where high skill and practice can defend enough to block the gambit and {0.SimFirstName} does not give up without catching every move the opponent makes against {M0.him}{F0.her}. Soon enough, the opponent draws and {0.SimFirstName} is the winner! </Text>
  <Text Key="7076B10E">The Plumbob Gambit is a move that takes some serious skill. Has {0.SimFirstName} practiced well enough to pull it off? {0.SimFirstName} gave it a try by using the countermove to beat the opponent with their own tactic. The opponent caught on quite quickly and blocked the countermovement. Oh, {0.SimFirstName} was so close! With more practice, {M0.he}{F0.she} might have been able to pull it off. </Text>
  <Text Key="B7AD8E73">This move takes some serious skill and {0.SimFirstName} has been practicing for this very moment. {M0.he}{F0.she} does not let the pressure get to {M0.him}{F0.her} and with a calm face manages to make the counter move!</Text>
  <Text Key="5112CF49">Everyone's talking about how {0.SimFirstName}'s code was expert level. A short while later, a Sim from the computer club seeks {0.SimFirstName} out to recruit their coding skills.</Text>
  <Text Key="209A8764">{0.SimFirstName} continues playing without making any code suggestions. The real objective is to get as much chess practice in as possible and the simulator, despite any bugs, is very helpful.</Text>

  <Text Key="F25AE460">{0.SimFirstName} humbly declines the challenge. {M0.His}{F0.Her} fellow classmate will just have to attend class like everybody else or ask another Sim to hack the system. </Text>
  <Text Key="0FDDF4B1">What could go wrong with a little hacking? {0.SimFirstName} hacks into the school gradebook and successfully switches grades around. While the hacking was done very well, {0.SimFirstName} gave the classmate all A's. That...looked very suspicious and {0.SimFirstName} was caught. </Text>
  <Text Key="28CC5AA4">{0.SimFirstName} humbly declines the challenge. {M0.His}{F0.Her} fellow classmate will just have to attend class like everybody else or ask another Sim to hack the system. </Text>
  <Text Key="78D7A16A">A Sim from the rival chess club finds out about the simulation program and is very impressed. Turns out the moves designed in the code were impressive and the fact that {0.SimFirstName} knew the moves makes the chess team want that skill as a part of their team. </Text>
  <Text Key="4E4B03DB">{0.SimFirstName} decides to use the simulation only for personal practice purposes. Seems like a good opportunity to practice improving the code without sharing it for public use. The time put in for personal growth and risk taking paid off in terms of personal performance on the team.</Text>
  <Text Key="8FE508D6">The Copperdale High School computer team didn't do so well out there today at the hackathon. The other teams had some fierce programming experience and a full-plan on how to pull it off in time.

  <Text Key="F2E71FB5">A fight is a fight and it's much more entertaining than practice! {0.SimFirstName} joins the others in cheering on the fight. Entertainment beats responsibility. </Text>
  <Text Key="1E257750">{0.SimFirstName} steps in and does the right thing. The teams are not there to fight today, there needs to be some kind of truce! The teammates apologize to each other for now. They thank {0.SimFirstName} for tremendous responsibility.  </Text>
  <Text Key="EE87E5AE">Wow, that {0.SimFirstName} can really move! A Sim from the Cheer Team saw {M0.his}{F0.her} standout moves and is recruiting {M0.him}{F0.her} to switch teams!</Text>

  <Text Key="A572F994">{0.SimFirstName} set up a plan to prank the guest coach with the rest of the team. They all managed to frighten the coach big time with an urban legend and sneaking up behind them when they weren't paying attention. The coach literally screamed! Hopefully they're not too scared right? The team all had a good laugh but got in trouble with the bad behavior.  </Text>
  <Text Key="A9C8C079">After thinking up a mischievous plan, {0.SimFirstName} realized it would not be nice to prank the guest coach. Better yet, {M0.he}{F0.she} did not want the rest of the team to get in trouble for it. Today will be another day of boring practice.  </Text>
  <Text Key="A790C903">A fight is a fight and it's much more entertaining than practice! {0.SimFirstName} joins the others in cheering on the fight. Entertainment beats responsibility. </Text>
  <Text Key="C9345072">{0.SimFirstName} steps in and does the right thing. The team should be bonding instead of fighting! The members of the team should all support each other rather than compete against each other. The others calmed down and try to work out the differences. It's a good thing {0.SimFirstName} stepped in.  </Text>
  <Text Key="DA4448C5">{0.SimFirstName} will need to take it easy for a little while and practice some old-fashioned self-care. It should not be too bad to take a few days off from practice, right? Since two team members are injured now, {0.SimFirstName} will make sure to voice concern about the dangerous moves, perhaps it's not the best way to go. </Text>
  <Text Key="BB2DED01">{0.SimFirstName} decided to play it safe this time by waiting to share the strategy idea after the meeting, just in case they flubbed the strategy in front of their crush. Once {0.SimFirstName} shared the strategy, the captain LOVED it. The team does well but there was a missed opportunity to show off a bit during the meeting. Maybe next time!</Text>
  <Text Key="800D587C">{0.SimFirstName} had been thinking of a great strategy for a while now and it seemed like the perfect time and place to voice the idea. {0.SimFirstName} confidently interjected and shared {M0.his}{F0.her} idea for the next competition strategy. There was a moment of silence around the room and then the captain applauded the idea. The team agrees to go with the strategy and {0.SimFirstName}'s crush looks really impressed too! However, {0.SimFirstName} was not as focused on practicing the strategy because {M0.he}{F0.she} was so distracted by impressing {M0.his}{F0.her} crush. </Text>
  <Text Key="C68DC450">{0.SimFirstName} tried to pull off some sophisticated moves as {M0.his}{F0.her} crush approached. However, the crush was oblivious to the art of the moves, seemingly unimpressed. Regardless of how the crush reaction was, {0.SimFirstName} didn't even know {M0.he}{F0.she} had it in {M0.him}{F0.her} to make such daring moves. {0.SimFirstName} ended up impressing {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, earning higher performance. </Text>
  <Text Key="9B4F6CB5">{0.SimFirstName} started showing off some stellar moves and {M0.his}{F0.her} crush noticed right away. While some good conversation started between them, {0.SimFirstName} became distracted, leaving practice and fancy moves in hindsight. Team performance suffers as a consequence.  </Text>
  <Text Key="F1E1A65F">Together, the team felt united getting revenge...but {0.SimFirstName} can't help but feel like maybe revenge was not the right way. </Text>
  <Text Key="ABB3205E">Made steps in the right direction with a Rival, but not with the team.</Text>
  <Text Key="2816FA13">The chemistry between the two is awkward and strained. The video goes viral... but in the worst way possible, highlighting all of {0.SimFirstName}'s mistakes. {F0.Her}{M0.His} flub hurts not just {F0.her}{M0.his} reputation but also {F0.her}{M0.his} bank account.</Text>
  <Text Key="1B896A26">The collab is a hit! Now, more and more people will know who {0.SimFirstName} is! Wow! Look at all of these viewers! YAY!</Text>
  <Text Key="E1CFE8D2">TitaniaChroma didn't appreciate the rejection and makes a video calling {0.SimFirstName} out. TitaniaChroma's followers have now made {0.SimFirstName} their enemy and {M0.his}{F0.her} comments are filled with negativity and claims that {0.SimFirstName} isn't even {M0.his}{F0.her} real name.</Text>
  <Text Key="39E05D7B">{0.SimFirstName} got a sudden surge of followers! The comments are saying how they respect {M0.his}{F0.her} drive and dedication to making it on {M0.his}{F0.her} own merit. Hard work really does pay off!</Text>
  <Text Key="DDBC3EB8">Oh no! {0.SimFirstName} now knows that {M0.he}{F0.she} has to be careful on who {M0.he}{F0.she} picks for sponsors. The product is sub-par and {M0.his}{F0.her} followers call {M0.him}{F0.her} out on the lack of honesty. {0.SimFirstName}'s lack of integrity has resulted in {M0.his}{F0.her} videos being demonetized.</Text>
  <Text Key="9A4021B5">Wow! The product the sponsors sent {0.SimFirstName} was amazing! {0.SimFirstName} got the sponsorship money, the product for free, and most importantly, was able to give an honest review of the product!</Text>
  <Text Key="95E564ED">As the saying goes, "You win some, you lose some". {0.SimFirstName} is proud to stick to {M0.his}{F0.her} morals and knows more opportunities will come. It is a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things.</Text>
  <Text Key="BE21EB84">{0.SimFirstName}'s followers praise {M0.his}{F0.her} honesty and are donating in droves in response! {M0.his}{F0.her} fanbase's love and support shine through the comments:\n\n"This is why we follow you!"\n\n"{0.SimFirstName} would never sell out!"\n\n"This is why we know we can trust you!"</Text>
  <Text Key="5352F039">{0.SimFirstName} spent so much time trying to get the program to work that {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't have time to polish the video. {M0.He}{F0.She} should have stuck with the program that was more reliable.</Text>
  <Text Key="49C11500">This is still in beta? This is AMAZING! Everything about this program is better. Easy and fast video editing. No crashes or hang-ups. {0.SimFirstName}'s video quality and content improved leaps and bounds!</Text>
  <Text Key="6286B5D4">{0.SimFirstName} decides to stick with the current version instead of updating to the new beta program. Unfortunately, the other Simfluencers that did switch are putting out better quality videos and much faster than {0.SimFirstName} can with the old software. Due to {0.SimFirstName}'s stubbornness, {M0.he}{F0.she} ran into more problems than usual with the current program and just couldn't get any content out at all.</Text>
  <Text Key="6B35FA01">Why fix what is not broken? {0.SimFirstName} stuck with {M0.his}{F0.her} ideals when that new beta version of the software came out. Clearly, never trust anything that is in beta. It simply means "Incomplete!". {0.SimFirstName} made the right call and was able to keep making good content at the same rate that resulted in a steady increase of Simoleons!</Text>
  <Text Key="43814D86">{0.SimFirstName} takes the opportunity but fails to put out a quality video. Viewers didn't know whether the product was good, bad, or even lukewarm due to {0.SimFirstName}'s poor performance. The comments were loud and clear when they expressed disappointment in {M0.his}{F0.her} review. {0.SimFirstName}'s performance and pride both suffer from the bad experience.</Text>
  <Text Key="131444CF">Luckily, the other Simfluencers are happy for {0.SimFirstName} and understand the choice to take the opportunity. The controversy is avoided and the company is ecstatic with the amount of marketing {0.SimFirstName} provided. Looks like another exclusive deal with the company may be on the horizon for {0.SimFirstName}.</Text>
  <Text Key="CE1EED47">The company is not pleased with {0.SimFirstName}'s rejection and decides to go with another Simfluencer. The successful video of the other Simfluencer makes it hard for {0.SimFirstName}'s review to compete. {0.SimFirstName} wonders what would have happened if {M0.he}{F0.she} would have taken the opportunity and released {M0.his}{F0.her} early.</Text>
  <Text Key="954BF78A">{0.SimFirstName} will wait to review until all Simfluencers have a chance to do so. The other Simfluencers caught wind of the chivalrous act and sent some extra donations {M0.his}{F0.her} way. {0.SimFirstName} earned more than just a few Simoleons. {M0.He}{F0.She} earned respect and new friends.</Text>
  <Text Key="6BB47720">Turns out there is a rule against taking such a large donation. Especially when it looks like a bribe to not get banned from the channel. Well, now it looks like {0.SimFirstName} is banned...but at least it's only for a few days.</Text>
  <Text Key="CDED6BBD">There is no rule against taking a large donation from a fan, right? {0.SimFirstName} thanks the viewer for the donation but gives one final warning about the rude behavior. The fan quickly apologizes and promises to never do so again. {0.SimFirstName} tells the chat that {F0.she}{M0.he} believes in second chances, but asks everyone to be respectful and caring to everyone in the community!</Text>
  <Text Key="A1DE8E35">{0.SimFirstName} banned the fan without explanation. The viewers were confused because they weren't even paying attention to what the fan was spamming in the chat.</Text>
  <Text Key="972E69AC">No! {0.SimFirstName} will not take any money from someone who has been bothering {M0.his}{F0.her} viewers! Everyone knows it is time to take out the ban hammer! Now the chat is safe and {0.SimFirstName} can focus on giving the viewers the best stream they have ever seen!</Text>
  <Text Key="34A1555B">{0.SimFirstName} feels good about denying everything and weaving in such an elaborate story to cover {M0.his}{F0.her} tracks.\n\nUnfortunately, that feeling was short-lived when the company replied with:\n\n"{0.SimFirstName}, we do not know how to tell you but...we have video evidence of you breaking the NDA recorded in your Livestream archives. Due to the breach of contract, we will no longer be working with you. You are untrustworthy."</Text>
  <Text Key="5411F1EE">{0.SimFirstName} did not know how {M0.he}{F0.she} did it, but the developers believed every word. Not only is {0.SimFirstName} getting off scot-free, but the developers are also paying {0.SimFirstName} extra as an apology for the accusation!</Text>
  <Text Key="F2F2B13A">{0.SimFirstName} braces {M0.himself}{F0.herself} for the company's reply:\n\n"Thank you for coming clean. We appreciate your honesty. Unfortunately, due to the leak of information to the public, we will have to charge you for breaking the contract. But it is a small fee! And we would like to continue working with you. Just be a little more careful!"</Text>
  <Text Key="D589AA23">{0.SimFirstName} braces {M0.himself}{F0.herself} for the company's reply:\n\n"That was...you? Thank you so much for doing that!! The publicity of the incident helped the team, and even if it was not part of our marketing strategy, it helped us out tremendously. Don't worry about the NDA. We're glad you did it and just wanted to thank you for it!"</Text>
  <Text Key="B626BCEA">What just happened? How is this fan so good at this game?! {0.SimFirstName} got destroyed at {M0.his}{F0.her} own game! DID THEY CHEAT?! How could {0.SimFirstName} lose?</Text>
  <Text Key="B8938513">{0.SimFirstName} will show no mercy. {M0.He}{F0.She} knows that the viewers want to see the skill difference between {M0.him}{F0.her} and the fan. Ruthless and efficient. Plus, the fan won't appreciate {0.SimFirstName} holding back.</Text>
  <Text Key="635CE8CB">{0.SimFirstName} figures that losing on purpose will make the fan happy. {0.SimFirstName} doesn't even try in the competition and loses quickly in order to continue with {M0.his}{F0.her} stream. Not realizing that in doing so, in such an obvious way, it only upset the fan and the viewers! After all, who would want to be pitied when competing in something that they love. Viewers were leaving the stream in droves. {0.SimFirstName} figures it is time to end the stream here.</Text>
  <Text Key="56A74ADE">{0.SimFirstName} decides that beating such a dedicated and loving fan in a game is not the right way to go. But {M0.he}{F0.she} still has a show to put on! So {0.SimFirstName} puts all of {M0.his}{F0.her} skill to use. A nail-biting display of skill! And then, {0.SimFirstName} in an upset, loses graciously to {M0.his}{F0.her} opponent. But in defeat, earns quite a few subscriptions and donations from the fans who loved the show.</Text>
  <Text Key="95650355">Wow, are viewers donating for {0.SimFirstName} to end the stream early? The viewers don't approve of cheesing the 24-hour streaming challenge by simply leaving the stream on and sleeping in front of the camera. {0.SimFirstName} thought the goal was just to last 24 hours not put on a show for 24 hours! This is a lot harder than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought it would be.</Text>
  <Text Key="372D31CC">Fans don't want to see a quitter! They want to see a WINNER! A streamer who finishes whatever they set their mind to!! {0.SimFirstName} powers through like the {M0.KING}{F0.QUEEN} {M0.he}{F0.she} is!</Text>
  <Text Key="CD07F2C0">{0.SimFirstName} cuts the stream short. The viewers did not hesitate to voice their disappointment in {0.SimFirstName} on Social Bunny. Maybe it will be good for {0.SimFirstName} to take a break from Social Bunny for the rest of the night.</Text>
  <Text Key="2EE060DD">{0.SimFirstName} decides to cut the stream but before {M0.he}{F0.she} can... M1nty_fresh comes in with the save! M1nty_fresh raids {0.SimFirstName} and offers to do a Collab where they decide to play The Sims Infinite together for the rest of the stream! The viewers are excited and start to subscribe and donate in droves! Guess {0.SimFirstName} can't stop now!</Text>
  <Text Key="7EE875AE">You're someone I know I can trust.</Text>
  <Text Key="9D23E560">I don't trust easily, but I trust you.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F8795F7">I knew you'd be trustworthy the minute I saw you!</Text>
  <Text Key="17AB683C">I get suspicious vibes from you.</Text>
  <Text Key="7BAEA8E5">How can I trust you when you act so suspicious?</Text>
  <Text Key="05B4CC1E">You aren't easy to trust. It makes you suspicious.</Text>
  <Text Key="2741B4BD">{0.SimFirstName} remembers how intimidating a new job can be without a friend, and powers through {M0.his}{F0.her} awkwardness to successfully make a good first impression on {M0.his}{F0.her} new work buddy. {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss also takes notice of the attempt at improving company morale, and adds a note to {0.SimFirstName}'s upcoming performance review.</Text>
  <Text Key="3DAA8218">{0.SimFirstName} fumbles {M0.his}{F0.her} words and really puts {M0.his}{F0.her} foot in {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss and coworker take some offense, and {M0.his}{F0.her} work performance suffers appropriately.</Text>
  <Text Key="A3031B0A">{0.SimFirstName}'s boss is disappointed with {M0.his}{F0.her} unfriendly behavior. Minor performance loss.</Text>
  <Text Key="460DB1B6">Well that went better than expected! {0.SimFirstName} has made a new (and very cool) friend and is feeling great after a big social success!</Text>
  <Text Key="20431C57">Whoops... {0.SimFirstName} kind of fumbled that one, hopefully there is still opportunity to become friends in the future.</Text>
  <Text Key="B4537929">{0.SimFirstName} has successfully avoided that terrifying yet enticing chance at high school popularity. You can't embarrass yourself if you don't say anything at all! Maybe next time {F0.she}{M0.he} can find the right words.</Text>
  <Text Key="697643EF">Phew, that went over well! {0.SimFirstName}'s relationship is back to normal, or rather, better than ever!</Text>
  <Text Key="C27C036E">Oh no! That apology was very not-so-smooth. Apparently, {0.SimFirstName}'s new co-worker has heard the llama insult before. {0.SimFirstName} should have been more sensitive. The relationship between the two suffers slightly.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F6B8F20">Things seem to blow over pretty quickly, and now {0.SimFirstName} knows that llamas are a touchy subject. {M0.He}{F0.She} will certainly avoid that one in the future.</Text>
  <Text Key="DB8DD585">Perhaps avoiding conflict out of fear is not the best idea. {0.SimFirstName} really hurt {F0.her}{M0.his} classmate's feelings, and not apologizing has made fixing the friendship even harder.</Text>

  <Text Key="4B0E80AD">That's not all! Staying around after school gives your teen a chance to get to know other classmates along with attending an exam study session on Wednesday afternoons. If your teen received detention during the day you'll want to be sure to serve detention!</Text>
  <Text Key="739F01FF">There are two ways to join an after-school activity! If you want to join a team right away, just check your mobile phone and select an after-school activity under the business app. Additionally, you can use a computer and using the High School tab for looking over and joining an after-school activity. \n\nThe other way to directly join an activity is to stay on campus after classes end for the day. Find your student activity representatives to ask them about activities and if you can join. Spot the student reps by the lockers after regular school hours, they will be holding signs to get your attention! </Text>
  <Text Key="B5860DEF">Your teen Sim has the opportunity to join an extracurricular activity that takes place after school hours!

Just check your practice meeting times under your high school career status. You'll be able to progress in your activity, so build up those skills to get recognized!

  <Text Key="7FE3DFC0">Not all teens have to make perfect grades to enjoy high school and become the Sims that they are growing into! While only one classroom is assigned to attend class (Active Teens will always be in Classroom 1), your teen will be able to choose other activities such as building skills elsewhere on campus. However, be careful of the principal if your teen chooses to leave during class - you may get caught for truancy!  </Text>
  <Text Key="7280B32E">With high school comes many opportunities for Sims, but there's no teenhood without some rules. Your teen has the freedom to express themselves however they want to, and there are many different ways to participate in the high school day. Let's get started with a few notes. No quiz necessary. </Text>
  <Text Key="2A4414B1">If you want your teen to excel in high school, there are a few ways you can help your teen achieve top grades. You will want to be sure your teen attends classes on time and finishes homework each day. Doing well in class can be enhanced by building certain relevant skills beforehand. This includes Writing, Logic, Charisma, Painting, and Programming. Sometimes, your teen will also earn skills while in class!  </Text>

  <Text Key="8E647737">Being a teen comes with a bit of growing pains sometimes, but every Sim is unique and these are not always a pain; they're also an empowerment! However your teen responds to puberty, some physical changes will start to appear for them, but you also have the ability to turn off some functionality if puberty is too much with preparing for the future.  </Text>
  <Text Key="155F4A43">You now have the option to have body hair! Teens will start to grow body hair throughout their teenhood, and there are ways that your teen can manage it as they prefer. This can be customized through Create a Sim. While in Create a Sim, select the Body category; there will now be options for you to choose from in terms of body hair. Selecting a thumbnail in Create a Sim will select a preferred length where your Sim can choose to shave down to the preferable length of hair. You can choose fun colors, or you can choose to turn growth off by selecting the growth button in Create a Sim. Facial hair will also grow to the preferred length and work the same way body hair does. </Text>
  <Text Key="D8120EB4">Every teen has the chance of getting acne. If this appears, try using the facial cleanser at the mirror that may reduce it, depending on the teen!  "OMG my Sim can't have an acne breakout during prom!" All good, we've all been there but your teen does not have to if you prefer - just go into your Gameplay setting and choose to disable acne for your teen. </Text>

Building a romance or devolving into  enemies are possible outcomes. You will also gain followers which can benefit the Video Game Streamer and Simfluencer careers. These followers follow you over to Trendi or Social Network accounts.</Text>
  <Text Key="E89A307B">Events in your Sims' lives will trigger the ability to post about that event for a limited time. You can frame the context of that event for your Sim.  Was that pillow fight they just participated in friendly, or did it get a little bit romantic?</Text>

  <Text Key="40A4DE69">Once you have created your Fashion Look you can put it on from your Sim's inventory! You can then engage in hyping out and promoting the outfit that you created to other Sims around the world! Hype will increase the value of your outfit when you decide to sell it using Trendi. The style trend of your Fashion Look will also increase which will change up the outfits worn by Sims in the world.</Text>
  <Text Key="60AA902A">Your Sim can put together their own outfit at ThrifTea by selecting one of the Clothing Racks and running the Create a Fashion Look interaction! In the Create a Fashion Look mode, you can put together a fashion look from a limited store inventory at a lower price than usual! Once you finish putting together your Fashion Look and purchase it, the outfit will appear in the Sim's inventory to try on!</Text>
  <Text Key="9E71FEA3">Sick of the outfit you made? Used it too many times? You can sell Fashion Looks that you have made any time you want! You can do this by opening the Sims inventory, selecting the outfit, and choosing the "Sell outfit on Trendi" interaction. You can also sell it via the phone by opening the Trendi App and selecting the List a Look functionality on the app! You can then try to sell the outfit at whatever price you feel it deserves! Careful, though! If you set the price too high, you might get fewer buyers! Remember, the higher the hype, the more demand for the outfit; the higher the price you can sell it!</Text>
  <Text Key="4454A9D5">Trendi can be accessed from a Sim's phone! ThrifTea can be found in Prescott Square in the Copperdale World! At ThrifTea you can chat with the ThrifTea Owner to talk shop about different outfits and trends!</Text>

  <Text Key="7F137E71">Don't worry, ThrifTea's inventory restocks every day so you can always find something new! Sometimes when ThrifTea restocks an Exclusive clothing item will appear in the shop.
