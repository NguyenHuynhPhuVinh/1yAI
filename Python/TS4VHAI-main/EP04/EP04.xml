Change your pet’s fur length, tail or ears from the options offered in the arc menu’s catalogs, and go to town with Paint Mode located in the Pelt Markings catalog. </Text>
  <Text Key="10D6CF60">Welcome to The Sims 4 Create a Pet! Meow ditty woofty woof!

This lesson will provide you with a quick overview on the features available in Create a Pet. The mechanics of creating your pets is very similar to creating a human Sim, with just a few key differences: they are generally furry and tend to stand on four legs. Click the arrow to the right and come see what’s new for your fluffy buddies!</Text>
  <Text Key="D2D271E5">Create a Sim starts you off with a premade human Sim. To add a cat or dog to the family, click the Add Sim button to the right of your human Sim’s skewer thumbnail.</Text>
  <Text Key="8B35E705">Based on the type of animal you choose, you will be presented with the dog or cat Breeds catalog to the right of your randomized starting pet. Choose the specific breed you had in mind as a starting point, or go all mutt and play with the different combos you can get by pressing the randomize button at the bottom of the screen. </Text>
  <Text Key="E2B51DF7">Create a Pet</Text>
  <Text Key="9D4D1C57">To access Paint Mode for your pet, open the Coat Color / Pattern catalog from the arc menu. The button is located at the very top, next to the marking’s color swatches. Make sure to choose a worthy base coat before jumping in to paint. The Coat Color / Pattern catalog has a lot of wonderful jumping off points or you can choose the first preset to just apply a flat base color. Now just click that paint button to get started!</Text>
  <Text Key="FC407D61">Looking for something a little more whimsy to decorate your pet with? Try the Stamps tab to find a host of cool fur patterns and funky designs. Last but not least is the Stencils tab which allows you to paint with precision in artist-crafted marking patterns. Play around with the Fill Bucket and multiple colors while in the Stencils tab for some crazy combinations!</Text>
  <Text Key="1587659A">When you’re done painting, go ahead and hit the return button at the top-left of the Painting Panel to return to all the other basic Create a Pet options.</Text>
  <Text Key="ED22A757">Below the color wheel you’ll find our library of paintbrushes and below those you’ll find the size and rotation sliders. If you’d prefer to not paint both sides at once and you’d rather paint more of an asymmetrical pet, uncheck the Mirror Paint toggle.\n\nYou can also paint on your pet's nose by clicking the nose paint buttons next to their face in near zoom.</Text>
  <Text Key="63246301">Having a hard time reaching or seeing a specific area to paint? Take advantage of the Pose buttons at the top of the screen. Those will get your pet to sit and give you easier access for painting its back, they’ll make your pet sit up so you can have better access to its belly or under its chin, and it will make your pet lay down and show you its belly because it’s just too darn cute.</Text>
  <Text Key="003B86F4">In addition to access to all the colors of the rainbow, there’s a handy set of tools for you to use when painting your pet. Use the eyedropper to copy a specific color from your pet, use the paint bucket to fill the whole animal with a single color, and use the eraser tool for any of painting’s little woops moments. There’s also an option to adjust the opacity of your paintbrush to help with blending.</Text>
  <Text Key="6B59FEC7">Just like you can directly push and pull to modify the shape of your pet, you can click and drag your cursor over your pet to paint any masterpiece you can imagine. The Painting Panel to the right gives you a set of base color swatches, as well as a robust color wheel to customize the color of your paintbrush exactly the way you want it. Click the square to the left of the color wheel to fine tune the hue/saturation/brightness settings manually.</Text>

Legend has it, in the earliest days of Brindleton Bay’s settlement, the citizens had no pets at all. The settlers had nothing to keep them entertained but tales of a plasma-sucking phantom that came in the night. One night, disaster struck. The Saint Bernard, a formidable ship to say the least, crashed headlong into the isle offshore and was lost to the waves. Mysteriously, lifeboats full of cats and dogs made their way to the shore, but there were no humans to be found. It is said that the Captain's ghost now roams the city at night, checking to make sure the ancestors of the pets that survived were given good homes, and that those lost in the crash are comfortably living out their nine afterlives on Deadgrass Isle.</Text>

  <Text Key="BC13E3C4">A series of paintings depicting Brindeton Bay’s earliest days. Before their pets crashed ashore, Brindletonians had an enormous amount of free time that they spent tending to the fields and perfecting the covered bridge that overlooks Sable Square. Following the arrival of cats and dogs during the Tragedy of the Saint Bernard, the town's obsession with their new four-legged friends would lead them to erect huge monuments to cats and dogs throughout the square, and kick start a burgeoning fishing and pet food industry. Today, the town is thriving, with feline and canine influences woven directly into the community's DNA. The locals have even elected a cat as their mayor!</Text>

  <Text Key="5CFA7121">All a dog and {M1.his}{F1.her} human need is a simple visit to the Town Square.</Text>
  <Text Key="67244708">{0.SimFirstName} would like to help every crying child in the world, but {M0.he}{F0.she} has {M0.his}{F0.her} own priorities. {M0.He}{F0.She} pulls {1.SimFirstName} back and keeps walking.\n\n{1.SimFirstName} seems a little miffed at first and takes {M1.his}{F1.her} time peeing on a fire hydrant. They finish their perfectly square walk, in perfect time. {0.SimFirstName} pets {1.SimFirstName} between the ears, and {1.SimFirstName} returns it with a sloppy kiss. It really was a good walk.</Text>
  <Text Key="69560229">{0.SimFirstName} would have to be a monster to ignore a crying child. {1.SimFirstName} leads them in a diagonal jaywalk across the street.\n\nThe toddler is incoherent. There isn't much {0.SimFirstName} can do, so {M0.he}{F0.she} tries to entertain the tot by having {1.SimFirstName} perform a trick. The toddler's distraught parent comes by soon after, at which point the tears are gone and the toddler is cheering in delight at The Fantastic {1.SimFirstName}'s Death-Defying Sit.\n</Text>
  <Text Key="9F6E5D58">Keep Walking</Text>
  <Text Key="EC5C6294">Stop to Talk</Text>
  <Text Key="2342BE68">Everything is going just as expected. {0.SimFirstName} takes the third left on the last turn towards home. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} can finally achieve {M0.his}{F0.her} dream: a square walk around the Town Square.\n\n{1.SimName} does not share his vision. Ahead, a toddler is crying on a bench and {1.SimName} tugs {M1.his}{F1.her} leash towards him.</Text>
  <Text Key="EBD61CAD">Just in time, {0.SimFirstName} contains {1.SimFirstName}'s animal instinct to launch into mud. With {1.SimFirstName} still suspended by the end of the leash, {0.SimFirstName} takes a second to look over and see what has the dog so intrigued.\n\nSomething is there, hidden under the mud. {0.SimFirstName} slacks the leash, allowing {1.SimFirstName} to pick it up. {1.SimFirstName}'s head is held high as {M1.he}{F1.she} proudly walks {M1.his}{F1.her} treasure home.</Text>
  <Text Key="414E486C">It was done in an instant. Forced forward by the sheer will for adventure, both dog and human catapult into mud. {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} finish their walk home, absolutely filthy.\n\n Even so, it's hard to stay mad. {1.SimFirstName} might smell like garbage, but {M1.his}{F1.her} tail is wagging. {0.SimFirstName}'s happy {M1.he}{F1.she} had a good time.</Text>

Expecting crisp outdoor air, {M0.he}{F0.she} chokes, coughing over a sudden overwhelming smell.\n\n {1.SimFirstName} has lead them to a dirt pile the size of a small schnauzer. {1.SimFirstName} lurches into it, head first. {0.SimFirstName} has a split second to react</Text>
  <Text Key="89889DF2">{1.SimFirstName} circles both of them nervously as they get back on their feet. {0.SimFirstName} gets up first and gives the stranger a hand.\n\nThey both laugh it off, and what started as a walk with two ends with three. {0.SimFirstName} has made a new acquaintance.</Text>
  <Text Key="8E2F9197">{0.SimFirstName} is dazed from the fall. {M0.His}{F0.Her} hands wave in the air as {M0.he}{F0.she} struggles to find {M0.his}{F0.her} balance.\n\nAfter a while, {0.SimFirstName} gets to {M0.his}{F0.her} feet, but the other person is nowhere in sight. They must've left {M0.him}{F0.her} lying on the ground. "What kind of person does that?" thinks {0.SimFirstName}. After {M0.he}{F0.she} returns home, {M0.he}{F0.she} gives {M0.his}{F0.her} canine companion an extra treat.</Text>

  <Text Key="0CDA4296">Just {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName}, out for a walk. {0.SimFirstName} appreciates time with {M0.his}{F0.her} pet, as it feels like sometimes {M0.he}{F0.she} obeys a compulsive need to socialize with other people. It's nice to have a moment alone.\n\nAs {0.SimFirstName} reflects on this, {M0.he}{F0.she} walks straight into someone turning the same corner and falls down. {1.SimFirstName} looks over {M0.him}{F0.her} with worry, wondering what {0.SimFirstName} will do next.</Text>
  <Text Key="ACC009B8">The two enter the Brindleton Light Information Center and Gift Shop, where an elderly white-haired man is selling postcards.\n\nHe sees them and brightens up. "The top of the lighthouse is always open for the best views of the bay, but I'm about to go on break. Next time, I'll take you through and teach you some interesting history!"\n\nWith that, he shoos them out where {0.SimFirstName} looks up at the lighthouse once more before heading home.</Text>
  <Text Key="88A9EE07">As tempting as it would be to explore the lighthouse on their own, {0.SimFirstName} encourages {1.SimFirstName} to stay on this side of the door.\n\nThe two browse the shop for a bit and learn some interesting facts - that the lighthouse has only been dark for 24 hours since it first opened and that the older stairways inside the lighthouse are closed but still considered perfectly safe to climb.\n\nAs {0.SimFirstName} looks over a poster with the historical timeline of the lighthouse, {1.SimFirstName} scurries back to {M0.him}{F0.her} in a rush, eyeing the door marked Private nervously. {0.SimFirstName} looks up and sees...what? A white flash going by? A...ghost? Impossible!\n\n{0.SimFirstName} promises {1.SimFirstName} they'll return next time to follow up.</Text>
  <Text Key="CEEA6C35">{0.SimFirstName} tries the door handle, which turns easily, and the two tumble through. After their eyes adjust to the darkness, they see a small storage area with boxes stacked on boxes.\n\nAt the end of the room is a rickety-looking roped-off stairway. {0.SimFirstName} notices a white tablecloth in a nearby storage box and slips it on. "Look, I'm a ghost!" {M0.he}{F0.she} shouts, as {1.SimFirstName} starts barking at something behind {0.SimFirstName}.\n\n{0.SimFirstName} can't see much with the tablecloth on {M0.his}{F0.her} head. {M0.He}{F0.She} pulls it off to see a small...apparition dart up the stairs. {1.SimFirstName} howls but the chase is already lost. "Probably just a raccoon," {0.SimFirstName} says, and pats {1.SimFirstName} on the head, promising to return to the lighthouse.</Text>

  <Text Key="30BE445F">They've barely rounded the block before {1.SimFirstName} takes off for the lighthouse. They step into the gift shop but the old man isn't there.\n\nThe two wait for a moment, but the stillness of the shop starts to give {0.SimFirstName} goosebumps. {1.SimFirstName} paws at a door off the back marked Private. Should the pair explore on their own?</Text>
  <Text Key="FA9B49B6">They walk in and the old man says, "ready to learn a little something?" As he begins the tour, {0.SimFirstName} interjects with a question about the supposed ghost that haunts the lighthouse.\n\n"Oh, that old story," the man mutters, as if he can't be bothered. "Some say it's the old pooch who belonged Mr. Friendly - the last person to run the lighthouse. Hanging around, unfinished business or some nonsense."\n\n"Mr. Friendly was let go when he let the lighthouse go dark, causing a shipwreck. That damn dog wouldn't leave, though, and died right in the lighthouse office." As the tour ends, the man sends {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} on their way, though the story of Mr. Friendly's dog makes their hairs all stand a bit straighter.</Text>
  <Text Key="8F0E9175">{0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} wait until the man's gone, then swoop into the shop and hurtle through the door they're not supposed to hurtle through. The two head up the rickety steps and find a door simply marked Office.\n\nThere's no lock and the door opens creakily. {1.SimFirstName} nudges {0.SimFirstName} toward the far wall, where on a bulletin board are pinned various articles about the Brindleton Wreck and a few pictures of a friendly-looking man and his dog in front of the lighthouse.\n\nHe's reading an article intently when {1.SimFirstName} nearly bowls {M0.him}{F0.her} over. That's when {0.SimFirstName} hears someone opening the door. The two hide in the shadows of the room; just in time, as the old man has returned and clatters into the room.\n\nHe's moving quickly and sounds angry. He mutters something about a change in the shipping schedule and storms out. {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} wait a good ten minutes before leaving themselves, nervous and suspicious.</Text>
  <Text Key="06EAF40A">Wait to Sneak In</Text>
  <Text Key="6D7E3AE7">Take the Tour</Text>
  <Text Key="533DE969">As {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} get to the lighthouse, they notice the old man once again working diligently.\n\nThey remember him mentioning that behind-the-scenes tour, but they also remember the staircase and the ghost. Or not - {0.SimFirstName}'s convinced {M0.himself}{F0.herself} there's a sensible explanation for all of this.\n\nShould they take the man up on his offer to show them around the lighthouse or wait for a moment when they can sneak into the lighthouse undisturbed?</Text>
  <Text Key="E4DBC645">"Oh, that old story," the man mutters, as if he can't be bothered. "Some say the pooch belonged to Mr. Friendly, who used run this lighthouse. That it still haunts it today! Unfinished business or some nonsense. But I've never seen nor heard it for as long as I've been here." By his slow movements, {0.SimFirstName} assumes that's quite some time.\n\n"You know what it is," the old man says. "I bet it's just some young rascals getting into our tablecloths we keep in storage and making out like they're a spirit."\n\nThe tour ends as abruptly as it began. As they head home, {0.SimFirstName} assures {1.SimFirstName} they'll return and figure out this whole ghost thing one way or another. {0.SimFirstName} looks back and a shiver goes down {M0.his}{F0.her} spine as {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the old man staring right at them from the darkened gift shop.</Text>
  <Text Key="F2196F7B">"It was a sad day, indeed," the old man replies. The man running the lighthouse at the time - one Mr. Friendly - had taken his dog to the vet, forgetting that a cargo ship was docking that night.\n\nThe lighthouse light was left off and the ship wrecked. While there were no deaths, a large crab shipment was lost and along with it, the lucrative contract Brindleton Bay had established with the crabbing company.\n\nThe man continues, "anyway, Mr. Friendly was sacked but his damn dog wouldn't leave the lighthouse and died soon after right in the office."\n\nThe tour ends soon after and {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} vow to return, though the story of the dog who died in the lighthouse haunts them on their way home.</Text>

  <Text Key="6E06AADE">Ask About the Lighthouse Going Dark</Text>
  <Text Key="384F8F48">As {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} get to the lighthouse, they notice the old man once again working diligently at the gift shop. He launches into a history of the lighthouse before they've said two words and continues talking as he guides them upstairs to the top of the lighthouse.\n\nIt's interesting, but a bit dry. Dates and names and construction materials all start to run together, and {1.SimFirstName} is starting to get restless. {0.SimFirstName} wants to ask about the ghost, but it also feels like a bit of a silly question.</Text>
  <Text Key="8E5B5F9C">{0.SimFirstName} spreads the glue on the floor of the lookout behind the old man, who is busy watching for something out at sea. It dries quickly.\n\n{1.SimFirstName} nuzzles the ghostly dog, who drifts through the old man. The sensation surprises him and he yelps and stumbles backwards. Right into the glue! He sticks and falls. {1.SimFirstName} growls at him and takes the man's hair in his mouth as {0.SimFirstName} approaches.\n\nHe's about to question the man when {1.SimFirstName} tugs on his hair and a mask pulls off his face, revealing the surly expression of a much younger man with blonde hair.</Text>
  <Text Key="32EC571F">{0.SimFirstName} throws the tablecloth on {1.SimFirstName}, who looks kind of sort of like a ghost dog. Still, it's better than nothing.\n\n{1.SimFirstName} charges at the old man, but as {M1.he}{F1.she} starts to bark the cloth falls off, revealing the ordinary corporeal dog that {1.SimFirstName} is. The old man chuckles and turns back to the sea.\n\nHis expression changes a few seconds later, though, as the actual ghost dog floats inches from his face. He staggers backward, trips on {1.SimFirstName}, and falls with a thump onto the floor of the lookout.\n\n{1.SimFirstName} takes the man's hair in his mouth as {0.SimFirstName} approaches. As {M0.he's}{F0.she's} about to question the man, {1.SimFirstName} tugs on his hair and a mask pulls off his face, revealing the surly expression of a much younger man with blonde hair.</Text>
  <Text Key="3E5495A2">Wait, what?</Text>
  <Text Key="D035BA81">Dress {1.SimFirstName} as a Ghost with a Tablecloth</Text>
  <Text Key="FD3BF682">Use the Wood Glue to Trap the Old Man</Text>
  <Text Key="096A695C">{0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} arrive at the lighthouse again, hoping to finally catch the alleged ghost.\n\nThe Private door is locked, so the two wind their way up to the top of the lighthouse. As they approach the top, {1.SimFirstName} calms {0.SimFirstName}, pointing out at the old man leaning on the railing.\n\nThe two hide behind a crate full of wood glue and tablecloths and listen to the man talking to himself. {0.SimFirstName} hears him cry something about his revenge being almost complete. Uh oh. That doesn't sound good.\n\nSuddenly, something rises out of the crate in front of them, and it's all {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} can do to not shout. It's the ghost! The ethereal hound seems friendly though, and gestures at the crate, then at the old man. {0.SimFirstName} nods, knowing what to do.</Text>
  <Text Key="85167DB8">{0.SimFirstName} looks at the young man and suddenly recognizes him. "You're Charlie Crabcakes!" {M0.he}{F0.she} shouts. "Heir to the Crabcakes fortune."\n\n"Yes," spits Charlie, "though not much of a fortune after the Brindleton Wreck where my dad's ship lost a year's supply of crabs! All because of that stupid Mr. Friendly and his sick dog." The ghost dog looks indignant and floats a few paces away.\n\n"I was going to turn the lighthouse off, make the big fish shipment crash, and Brindleton Bay was sure to give crabs another chance! And I would have gotten away with it, too, if hadn't been for these two meddling dogs!"\n\n"But...why the mask?" asks {0.SimFirstName}. Charlie wrenches himself away from {1.SimFirstName}, ditches his shoes, and hops to the edge of the lighthouse.\n\n"I've got tons of masks!" he shouts, adding "and I'll get my revenge! You'll see." He jumps and {0.SimFirstName} gasps, but Charlie spreads his arms and he has some kind of glider jacket that catches the wind, as he disappears into the darkness of the water below.\n\nIt's not really an answer, and {0.SimFirstName} is still confused, but it seems that they've done their good deed for the moment and made a new ghostly friend. The ghost dog licks {0.SimFirstName}'s face - which, for the record, feels super weird but also comforting - then disappears down into the heart of the lighthouse.\n\n{0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} head home, content.</Text>
  <Text Key="19E38F86">The two head to the office. Inside, the ghost is lounging in the corner. It sees {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} and jumps up in excitement.\n\nThe two dogs - one of this world, the other from beyond - skitter across the small office for a time, as {0.SimFirstName} reads some stories of Brindleton past.\n\nAfter some time, the two head home, promising the ghost that they'll return again soon.</Text>
  <Text Key="D5D9074B">Though {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} search high and low, there's no ghostly dog to play with today.\n\nThey do notice a few more scratches and dog food crumbs around the lighthouse. {1.SimFirstName} is too busy munching on the crumbs to notice, but {0.SimFirstName} swears that he hears a slight echo of a howl as they head for home.</Text>
  <Text Key="6BD30699">As {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} reach the top of the lighthouse, they see the ghost swooping in and out of the light. {1.SimFirstName} barks and the ghost notices them and floats down to play.\n\n{1.SimFirstName} chases the ghost - or is the other way around? - in a circle around the light, while {0.SimFirstName} enjoys some of the best views of the bay.\n\nAfter some time, {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} head back home, promising the ghost that they'll return again soon.</Text>
  <Text Key="0EB83641">Regular Stairs</Text>
  <Text Key="88AD0C5B">Private Area</Text>
  <Text Key="C5CDA788">{0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} find themselves back at the Brindleton Light.\n\nThe two look up at it, then at each other, remembering the odd adventure they had there not too long ago. "Come on," {0.SimFirstName} says to {1.SimFirstName}. "Let's go see if our dog pal from beyond is around."\n\nThe shop is empty today, though there are now a revolving group of volunteers who help run it. {1.SimFirstName} paws gently at the Private door, before walking over and looking up the regular stairs.</Text>
  <Text Key="CC5C6A21">The Market</Text>
  <Text Key="4BF7625C">The Shoals</Text>
  <Text Key="B2BC0A53">The Harbor</Text>
  <Text Key="43F33FDB">{0.SimFirstName} doesn't need {1.SimFirstName} to be drawn to the docks. Laughs from the regulars at The Salty Paw mix with the caws of gulls resting on the shoals. {0.SimFirstName} watches a group of them fly up and across the sails of boats docked at the harbor.\n\n{0.SimFirstName} has {M0.his}{F0.her} pick of places to go.</Text>
  <Text Key="DE7D10A6">{1.SimFirstName} takes the lead, dashing after the black figure, with {0.SimFirstName} not far behind. Salt-crusted wooden crates tower increasingly higher above them, until the horizon is lost. At the darkest corner, {1.SimFirstName} stops and turns {M1.his}{F1.her} head straight up. Above, a black cat with large yellow eyes is perched on the edge of the crate, watching them like a falcon. Is this what they've been chasing?\n\n{0.SimFirstName} approaches carefully. {M0.He}{F0.She} inches forward, until {M0.he}{F0.she} is close enough to touch it. But {1.SimFirstName} cannot bear the anticipation any longer and barks in protest. The black cat disappears into the crates. {1.SimFirstName} keeps barking at the shadows, but {0.SimFirstName} knows it's gone. "Forget it {1.SimFirstName}, it's Whiskerman's Wharf."</Text>
  <Text Key="1755CF96">{0.SimFirstName} looks down at {M0.his}{F0.her} dog, so eager to follow the figure into the crates. Together, they've run past the entire market tracking it down. "Is what we want really at the end of the trail?" ponders {0.SimFirstName}.\n\n{0.SimFirstName} ends {M0.his}{F0.her} trip sitting on a patio of the Salty Paw overlooking the sea. Soon {0.SimFirstName}, the bartender and twelve bearded fishermen are singing sea shanties. {1.SimFirstName} howls along in tune.</Text>
  <Text Key="DB2C21B8">The Salty Paw</Text>
  <Text Key="64C8B1BB">The Crates</Text>
  <Text Key="307733AA">As promised, they return to the pier. A regular at the Salty Paw recognizes {0.SimFirstName} and waves. He calls {0.SimFirstName} over. Meanwhile, {1.SimFirstName} has picked up {M1.his}{F1.her} trail. A dark blur dashes into towering crates at the unloading dock, and {1.SimFirstName} barks wildly after it.\n\nWhere should they go?</Text>
  <Text Key="10AEFE64">Whiskerman's Wharf</Text>
  <Text Key="CADD2A4E">The crowded marketplace is packed with sights and smells. But {1.SimFirstName} is interested in only one. {M1.He}{F1.She} darts between barrels of fish and over cobblestone streets in pursuit of the scent. {0.SimFirstName} just tries to keep up.\n\n Finally, they stop on a balcony overlooking the sea. {1.SimFirstName}'s trail has gone cold. {0.SimFirstName} pats {1.SimFirstName}, trying to cheer {M1.him}{F1.her} up. Next time, they'll return.</Text>
  <Text Key="81B75092">{0.SimFirstName} takes three ginger steps onto the deck and knocks on the door. "Who's there?" cries a voice from inside. {0.SimFirstName} takes a step back as the door opens to reveal an old woman with silvery hair swept up in a bun on her head. She's wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a long floral pink dress. "No solicitors!"\n\nBefore {0.SimFirstName} can respond, {1.SimFirstName} runs past both of them in through the cabin doors. "What's this!" she yells. "Get your animal off my skipper!" But just as quickly, {1.SimFirstName} comes running back out carrying a cardboard bag of what smells like fish. {M1.He}{F1.She} darts through the woman's legs, off the boat, and back up the harbor. {0.SimFirstName}'s dog has just committed robbery, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides it's a good time to leave. As {1.SimFirstName} and {0.SimFirstName} head home, "My Trout!" echo in the distance.</Text>
  <Text Key="A27D90A9">{0.SimFirstName} doesn't want to take any chances, and decides to look through the window first. {1.SimFirstName} is right at {M0.his}{F0.her} feet, and gets to the window first. On seeing what's inside, {1.SimFirstName}'s hairs raise and begins to growl. What could be inside? The cabin is so low that {0.SimFirstName} has to bend down to get a look.\n\n Two green eyes and a set of whiskers are staring back at {0.SimFirstName}. A cat wearing a sailor's hat is standing with two hind legs on the driver's seat and two paws on the helm. It blinks, staring at {0.SimFirstName} blankly. \n\nOutside, {0.SimFirstName} hears the propeller start and the boat begins to back away from the dock. Tearing {1.SimFirstName} away from the absurd scene, they both get off the boat. It sails away, cruising into the horizon.</Text>
  <Text Key="717470F6">Knock</Text>
  <Text Key="61F2AF89">Look Through the Window</Text>
  <Text Key="39A3DFDB">They return to the harbor, and pick up the trail where {1.SimFirstName} left it. Only this time, there's something there.\n\n {0.SimFirstName} walks them down the harbor to the last boat on the dock. It is a tiny blue and white skipper with "Old Lady Sea" written in black across the bow. A tiny door to the cabin is just across the deck, as is a small window. Knocking would be polite, but taking a peak through the window might give {0.SimFirstName} more of an idea what {1.SimFirstName} was chasing after.</Text>
  <Text Key="59EF1BE3">{1.SimFirstName} leads them on a trail down the windswept hills into the wide open harbor of Whiskerman's Wharf. Schooners and skippers docked in soft rows bob gently with the tide. {0.SimFirstName} admires the scene, but {1.SimFirstName}'s nose is to the ground. {M1.His}{F1.Her} focus is entirely on the fresh scent of a trail. {0.SimFirstName} follows {M1.him}{F1.her} through the docks.\n\nFinally, {1.SimFirstName} stops at a wooden dock, but whatever boat was there is gone. The trail's gone cold. {0.SimFirstName} promises they'll return next time.</Text>
  <Text Key="D3AA714A">There's no telling what sharp rocks lies beneath the dark water's surface, and {0.SimFirstName} just isn't willing to take that chance. Time slows down as {0.SimFirstName} launches forward and grabs {1.SimFirstName} around the middle just as {M1.he}{F1.she} is mid leap. It is an act of gravity-defying athleticism that you'd have to see to believe.\n\n {0.SimFirstName} is sure to spend the rest of the week reliving how {M0.he}{F0.she} saved {M0.his}{F0.her} dog from the rocky depths in a mid-air rescue. {0.SimFirstName} returns home with a confidence boost.</Text>
  <Text Key="97D3E665">{0.SimFirstName} recoils from the large splash after {1.SimFirstName} makes the jump. As {M0.he}{F0.she} rubs salt water from {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes, {0.SimFirstName} bends over the rock to try and locate {M0.his}{F0.her} adventurous animal, who has disappeared beneath the water. {1.SimFirstName} is nowhere to be seen.\n\nDesperately, {0.SimFirstName} scans the water's surface. A dark blur moves just a few feet in front of {M0.him}{F0.her}. {M0.He}{F0.She} sighs in relief as it makes its way towards {M0.him}{F0.her}. {M0.He}{F0.She} reaches out {M0.his}{F0.her} hand to help {1.SimFirstName} back up, but instantly draws it back when a furless, wire-whiskered head appears in {1.SimFirstName}'s place. It's a sea lion!\n\n{1.SimFirstName} pops {M1.his}{F1.her} head out of the water soon after. It appears the two have an accord. {0.SimFirstName} helps {1.SimFirstName} back up the shoals, and they say goodbye to their friend for today.</Text>
  <Text Key="E04BC558">Keep {M1.Him}{F1.Her} Back</Text>
  <Text Key="42CA2714">Cannonball</Text>
  <Text Key="D31C8900">As promised, {1.SimFirstName} is returned to {M1.his}{F1.her} trail along the shoals. {1.SimFirstName} picks up right where {M1.he}{F1.she} left off, racing among the rocky crags tracking a scent.\n\n On a particularly high rock on the water's edge, {1.SimFirstName} stops. {M1.His}{F1.Her} eyes lock on something in the sea. More worrisome to {0.SimFirstName}, {M1.he}{F1.she} looks like {M1.he's}{F1.she's} about to jump.\n\n Should {0.SimFirstName} let {1.SimFirstName} jump or encourage him to stay on the surface?</Text>
  <Text Key="25021360">{0.SimFirstName} in fact has no choice at all. Instead, {M0.he}{F0.she} is pulled forward as {1.SimFirstName} races after a scent in the deep shoals. They spend their time climbing over tidepools and between jagged rocks. {1.SimFirstName} wants to stay and keep searching, but {0.SimFirstName} takes them home. Next time, they'll return.</Text>
  <Text Key="A4C2686E">On {0.SimFirstName}’s ok, {1.SimFirstName} takes off. The path looks to be going to the old Brindleton Bay Lighthouse. There are rumors around town of a malicious ghost dog that haunts the bay. Old Lady Crabtree says he can be found late at night, howling from the top of the tower. "I’m sure it’s just superstition," {0.SimFirstName} thinks.</Text>

  <Text Key="0EA158F1">It's time for an adventure. {1.SimFirstName} sniffs the air, picking up three distinct paths. Distracted by scents in all directions, {1.SimFirstName} needs some help deciding. Which way should {0.SimFirstName} take them?</Text>

  <Text Key="F32BE077">Once you’ve set up your course, click on any of the objects and select the “Run Obstacle Course with…” interaction, and then pick a pet you’d like to run the course with. Depending on your pet’s mood, your Sim’s Pet Training Skill, and some good old-fashioned luck, you might get a gold medal!</Text>
  <Text Key="9132DEFD">Want to get your cat or dog some exercise in a fun way? Set up an obstacle course in your backyard! \nThere are hoops to jump through, ramps to walk up, poles to weave through, tunnels to crawl in, and platforms to stand on!</Text>

  <Text Key="EC7B0236">Cats and Dogs are less complex than Sims. They have basic needs like Hunger, Bladder, and Affection/Play. As long as you feed them twice a day, take them out, and play with them on a regular basis, they will be content.</Text>
  <Text Key="38A4A5D6">Cats and Dogs have a much smaller Emotional scale than Sims. Cats and Dogs will mostly be fine, but sometimes they will become uncomfortable. This means they need something. Try Clicking them and Asking Them "What's Wrong" to find out more information.</Text>
  <Text Key="872BC5FD">Cats and Dogs will try telling you they need something by barking or meowing with a helpful thought balloon to point you in the right direction. Be sure to pay attention to their thought balloons.</Text>

  <Text Key="B49E98C8">In addition to Traits, Pets also have unique sets of obsessions and fears. Two pets with the exact same traits might have totally different things that they’re fond of and afraid of!</Text>
  <Text Key="8DA10E8A">Pets who are obsessed with certain things will get excited when that object is nearby or in use. On the other hand, pets who fear those objects won’t be too happy when your Sim uses them. Pay attention to your pet likes and dislikes to make your home comfortable for your furry friend.</Text>

  <Text Key="6FBFCCFF">When your dog indicates that it needs to go potty through whining at the door and thought balloons you will be able to Ask to Go Potty, and they will find an outdoor location to go. The more you encourage them to go outside and reprimand them for going potty indoors will teach them the proper location to go potty in the future.</Text>
  <Text Key="797095AD">When your dog has learned these tricks any Sim that has a good relationship with your dog can Command them to do these tricks. As you gain skill with Pet Training you will be able to teach and command more interesting tricks like Play Dead or have them Perform Tricks for passing Sims.</Text>
  <Text Key="3261F500">Dogs will need to be taught tricks individually, but you will be able to teach dogs any Tricks you know how to teach.</Text>
  <Text Key="650389C0">True to any Pet, the Cats and Dogs in The Sims 4 misbehave. You will see them scratching the furniture, drinking from puddles, or even playing in the trash. While you could let this behavior continue, it’s best to teach your pet to stop these behaviors. When you see your cat or dog misbehaving you will see the option to Lecture or Scold them about this misbehavior. Select one of those options and your Sim will reprimand the cat or dog for the selected misbehavior.</Text>
  <Text Key="B0E77A30">Each misbehavior will have to be reprimanded out separately, which will allow you to decide if a specific behavior is something you would allow your pet to continue doing.</Text>
  <Text Key="D7F85896">While the change won’t be immediate you should see your pets misbehaving less after reprimanding them, and with enough reinforcement they will learn to not misbehave in such a way.</Text>
  <Text Key="DADDAC77">What is one of the best things about dogs besides the unconditional love and affection? Obviously training them to do tricks. With any adult aged dog you will be able to start training with simple tricks like Sit, Speak, and Lie Down.</Text>

Read the “Vet Clinic – Ratings” lesson for more tips on how to effectively service your customers.</Text>
  <Text Key="F0F2AC7C">When you first arrive at your Vet Clinic lot you’ll be asked to transfer some funds to your business to cover basic operating expenses. To learn more about managing your money, read the “Vet Clinic – Funds” lesson.</Text>
  <Text Key="969D873A">You’ll need a functioning Vet Clinic before you can open for business. Luckily you have the latest and greatest in veterinary technology at your disposal. You’ll need to place at least one Examination Table, Vet Podium, and trash can. \nIt’s also a good idea to place a Surgery Station, Medicine Crafting Table, and Medicine Vending Machine to broaden the options available at your Vet Clinic. You’ll see both cats and dogs of all shapes and sizes come in once you open a Vet Clinic, so it’s good to be prepared for anything.</Text>
  <Text Key="F3EA83A0">Sims can own and manage Vet Clinics to earn Simoleons. To purchase a Vet Clinic, use the Phone or Computer and select “Buy a Vet Clinic”. You can also use the Owned Businesses panel to buy a business. You can buy an existing Vet Clinic, or purchase any unoccupied lot and start from scratch.</Text>
  <Text Key="1F6357B8">Check out the Owned Businesses panel in the bottom right hand corner. This is where you open and close your Vet Clinic. You’ll find useful information and shortcuts that will help you customize and run your Vet Clinic here. You can even open your Vet Clinic while you’re not there and have your employees earn you money while you’re away!</Text>
  <Text Key="1451F7B9">If you decide you no longer want to own your Vet Clinic, you can offload it by using the “Sell Venue” button in the Vet Clinic Settings Panel. Your business’s funds will be added to the value of the lot and get refunded to your household. Once you’ve sold your Vet Clinic, it’ll continue to be run under new management, and you can even bring your own pet there for checkups and treatments!</Text>

  <Text Key="1E044994">Use the “Manage Employees” button on the Owned Businesses panel to quickly check the status of your employees.

  <Text Key="8C70BBF1">Running a Vet Clinic by yourself is entirely possible, but it’s going to be hard to juggle practicing veterinary medicine and the business side of things. It’s a good idea to hire employees to do some works like treating patients, crafting medicines, and ickier tasks like mopping up the floor. \nSelect “Manage Employees” on your Owned Businesses Panel to view a list of Sims to hire. Review their skills and starting pay to determine if they’re a good match for your Vet Clinic. If you don’t like the list of applicants, simply try again later and new Sims might apply.</Text>
  <Text Key="DADAD91A">As your Vet Clinic becomes more successful and well known, you can unlock perks to hire additional Veterinarians using your Perk Points. See the “Vet Clinic – Perks” lesson for more details.</Text>
  <Text Key="FB87A04D">Vet Employees have 3 different skills that determine how well they work. Review these skills on the “Manage Employees” panel. If you can’t find the perfect Sim to hire, don’t worry! Employees will slowly gain skills over time as they work. The best way to raise an employee’s skills more quickly is to send them to after work training. Just be prepared to pay for it!</Text>
  <Text Key="86C9DF9B">An employee’s satisfaction is raised by being paid appropriately for their skill level, receiving praise from their boss, and getting promoted. Berating your employees, demoting them, or working them for long hours without break will lower their satisfaction. If they get too upset, don’t be surprised when they quit!</Text>
  <Text Key="D718A15D">Since your Sim is the boss, they have to manage their employees. Your Sim can check in on, praise, criticize, pay for training, promote / demote, or even fire each employee.</Text>
  <Text Key="5B518560">Vet Clinic - Employees</Text>
  <Text Key="4B99D5A5">As a business owner, your funds are tracked separately from your normal household funds. Each business that you own has its own separate funds that are used to cover the business’s expenses. When you visit your business, you can simultaneously view your business’s funds in the Owner Businesses panel in the bottom right corner, along with your household’s funds in the bottom left corner.</Text>
  <Text Key="D0EAC7D8">You can click on the View Last Finances/View Shift Summary button on the Owner Businesses panel to get a detailed breakdown of your profits and expenses. Use this information to make strategic decisions about your business to help maximize profits.</Text>
  <Text Key="D348DDEC">Every action taken as an owner while at your business uses money from your business’s funds. This includes building on the lot, placing objects, paying your employees, purchasing advertising, and more. When you enter Build Mode, the money shown in the bottom left corner will switch to display your business funds that you’re building with. Finally, any money you earn from your business will be deposited into your business funds.</Text>
  <Text Key="8D23369E">At any time, you can use the Venue Funds Transfer button near your household’s Simoleons in the bottom left corner to move money between your household and any of the businesses that you own. Within this panel, you can select the account you’re transferring from and to, and enter the amount of Simoleons you want to transfer.</Text>
  <Text Key="8DD7889B">There’s a chance that your business can go into debt if you don’t have enough money to pay your employees or you purchase advertising while low on funds. If your business doesn’t have enough money to pay its debts, you won’t be allowed to reopen your business until those debts have been cleared. Transfer money from your household to your business to cover your debts.</Text>

  <Text Key="1CC61627">Perks have a direct impact on your Vet Clinic and your household’s Sims that you’re playing. Employees that you fire are not affected by Perks. Instead, employees can be improved separately by building their skills at various tasks. You can learn more about that in the “Vet Clinic – Employees” lesson.</Text>
  <Text Key="545C9A7A">Perks are the key to building more efficient Vet Clinics. They will allow you to make your Vet Clinic more profitable and popular. \nThere are a wide variety of perks to choose from. You can unlock the ability to hire additional Veterinarians, change supply quality, and even make pets less stressed during procedures.</Text>
  <Text Key="279D1913">Owners of Vet Clinics can earn Perk Points from running their Vet Clinic. \nPlayers can use those Perk Points to buy Perks which make the Vet Clinic more effective. You’ll find various Perks within the Owner Businesses panel in the bottom right corner of the screen.</Text>
  <Text Key="68212B55">Earning Perk Points is simple- examine and treat pets. Interacting with customers and their furry friends will also provide Perk Points. Employees will not earn Perk Points for you, so get to work!</Text>
  <Text Key="843D7C7C">Some Perks provide a temporary bonus, such as the ability to get an influx of extra patients. You can return to purchase these Perks again in the future once your original purchase runs out.</Text>
  <Text Key="91E348D4">Vet Clinic - Perks</Text>
  <Text Key="2FCC9D27">You can review details on the Vet Clinic’s rating by hovering over the star rating or clicking on the View Last Finances/View Shift Summary button. Review the summary of feedback to find out what is going well and what needs improvement.</Text>
  <Text Key="E597525A">Each customer will display a rating over their head while at the Vet Clinic. The pets will not have a rating over their heads, but you can easily find their owners by hovering over them. When you finish examining and treating a pet, the customer will leave a rating and it will be added to your overall Vet Clinic rating. Care kindly and efficiently for your customers’ pets to raise their rating!</Text>
  <Text Key="77CA7750">Quality of care, supply quality, wait times, proper bedside manner, cleanliness, and Vet Clinic ambiance will all impact a customer’s rating. \nVeterinarians with high skills will provide better services and be more effective at treating pets. Make sure you have enough staff hired to keep your waiting room from piling up with sick pets.</Text>
  <Text Key="DFBEA127">Pay close attention to the icons of the Sim’s heads. They will show when the Sim’s rating of the Vet Clinic changes and indicate why. If you miss a change, the tool tip on each Sim will show their last bit of feedback.</Text>
  <Text Key="E734FAF0">Customers and their pets will enter the Vet Clinic while it is open, and will gather around the Check-in Podium. Your Vet Clinic’s overall rating and advertising will determine how many patients stop by and how much money you can earn. You can also purchase perks that increase the number of patients.</Text>
  <Text Key="CAF3B5B5">Vet Clinic - Ratings</Text>
  <Text Key="95737535">When your pet finally gets seen by a Veterinarian, you’ll need to wait patiently as they perform the proper exams and procedures. Once they finish, you’ll be prompted to choose a treatment option. The cheap option will always result in a cone of shame for your pet, which isn’t going to make them happy!</Text>
  <Text Key="7A86EB68">Once you get to the Vet Clinic, look for the Vet Podium so you can sign your pet in. Depending on how busy the Vet Clinic is, you might have to wait a bit for a Veterinarian to get to you.</Text>
  <Text Key="6D1F4371">Visiting a Vet Clinic is never the highlight of owning a pet, but sometimes your furry friend gets sick and you’ve got to get them treated! \nYou can also get your pet a checkup if you’re worried they might be sick but aren’t sure yet, or take them to the Vet Clinic for spaying and neutering.</Text>
