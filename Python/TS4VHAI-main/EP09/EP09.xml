A Civil Designer by trade, Bess placed herself in the perfect position to convince city officials and residents alike to enact programs that would benefit her bottom line. Her partner-in-crime, Jules, is a Style Influencer that loves fashion as much as he loves convincing people to buy his rejected styles.

Age isn't on their side anymore, however. It's a good thing their adopted son Knox is fighting for the family name to help make the world a little more green. Unfortunately, sometimes he takes "fighting" a little too literally.</Text>

  <Text Key="2C7DA4D6">Town Hall of the Future</Text>
  <Text Key="725243B9">A string of recent errors compounded by this easy to avoid mistake causes a lack of confidence in the planning authorities. {0.SimFirstName}'s boss gives them a stern telling off and warning about future mistakes.</Text>

  <Text Key="ED8CA4B1">With this delay, Sims are seeking out other Green Technicians to install their solutions. Sadly, this is causing a loss of business for {0.SimFirstName}</Text>
  <Text Key="4772EF58">In revealing the flaws in the process and offering to fix existing problems, {0.SimFirstName} has gained a lot of credibility in the neighborhood.</Text>

  <Text Key="6638E9BC">Some Sims like green. Other Sims might prefer a dustier shade of gray. So be it. Because of the Repeal of &lt;b&gt;Green Initiatives in Port Promise&lt;/b&gt;, the freshly-planted trees must go. Expect to see a reduction in green in the course of the upcoming week.\n\nDon't worry, the trees will be replanted somewhere they will be better appreciated.</Text>
  <Text Key="202CBFEC">Port Promise has officially become more Green! This concludes all planting efforts for &lt;b&gt;Green Initiatives in Port Promise&lt;/b&gt;. Enjoy the fresh air!</Text>
  <Text Key="13E85F5A">And with one last pluck of a bewildered sapling, thus concludes the removal of all changes brought by the &lt;b&gt;Green Initiatives&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nPort Promise has been successfully returned to its gray and sepia roots.</Text>
  <Text Key="F2D28D1C">All planting efforts for &lt;b&gt;Green Initiatives in Conifer Station&lt;/b&gt; have been completed! Residents, enjoy your greener, fresher neighborhood!\n\nYou've earned it.</Text>
  <Text Key="6FF2164A">The last of the uprooting has been achieved. The residents of Conifer Station now live in a neighborhood that is less Green.</Text>

  <Text Key="2082A96D">And just like that, &lt;b&gt;Green Initiatives in Conifer Station&lt;/b&gt;, Repealed. May the plucking commence!</Text>
  <Text Key="ACBD8909">This place &lt;i&gt;reeks&lt;i/&gt; of evergreen! Great job, residents of Grimms Quarry. The fertilizer experiment was a wild success (thank goodness) and you can now enjoy a greener Eco Footprint, as well as a blanket of prickly new forest friends.</Text>
  <Text Key="48940119">And so completes the deforestation in accordance with the Repeal of &lt;b&gt;Green Initiatives in Grims Quarry&lt;/b&gt;. I hope nobody got too attached to those trees...</Text>
  <Text Key="4BFD081F">&lt;b&gt;Green Initiatives in Grims Quarry&lt;/b&gt; has been passed! Looks like that experimental evergreen fertilizer the community has funded is already working! Just smell that sap... delicious.</Text>
  <Text Key="396185AB">Not to get too sappy, but I for one am really going to miss all of these delightful conifers. But the law is the law, and &lt;b&gt;Green Initiatives in Grims Quarry&lt;/b&gt; has been repealed. The deforestation process will begin immediately.\n\nDon't worry, we'll find a new home for these noble pines.</Text>
  <Text Key="AFFF72AA">Modern Development</Text>
  <Text Key="D7F35E14">The community's funding has helped pay for a scrub down and a striking cyan paint job for the crane by the docks. So shiny!</Text>
  <Text Key="4D721770">That cyan hue on the crane was wonderful while it lasted, but without funding to pay for cleaning and upkeep, it has quickly degraded to its former rusty state.</Text>
  <Text Key="9A7153A6">With Port Promise's final and most exciting Modern update, we've saved the best for last! We've hired a team of local artisans to give the refinery a vibrant new artistic look. They've really outdone themselves with colorful brick work on the ground surrounding the area, vibrant art pieces lining the walkway, and a delightful trio of Void Critter murals on the tank.\n\nAnd that concludes our transformation. On to new territory for Port Promise!</Text>
  <Text Key="AA85A1BE">Now that the funding is gone, we figured we'd be proactive and just remove all the nice artwork around the refinery. Upkeep would have been pricey.\n\nWith that, the removal of all advancements brought with &lt;b&gt;Modern Development in Port Promise&lt;/b&gt; has concluded.\n\nPort Promise is back to its dreary origins.</Text>
  <Text Key="0D748C3E">The new streets have been getting such rave reviews that we funneled some of our funding into some new, more modern brickwork around our walkways.\n\nNow the residents of Port Promise can step in and on style!</Text>
  <Text Key="B59D4BE4">Turns out that fancy new brickwork was pricey to maintain. At the sign of the first crack, we figured it was best to just revert the area back to the concrete slabs we had before.</Text>
  <Text Key="338F95C7">The votes are in and &lt;b&gt;Modern Development in Port Promise&lt;/b&gt; starts right now! This port does indeed have a lot of promise, so let’s see what contemporary improvements lie ahead.\n\nTo kick off development, the center streets have been paved with a luxurious experimental pavement made from recycled astroturf that leads to a striking propeller modern art piece. This handsome, historic propeller was flown in as a way for Port Promise to commemorate our history, while also looking toward our bright future.\n\nMore changes ahead in the following week!</Text>
  <Text Key="FE319115">The experimental roads had a fundamental flaw in their design. Without extra funding from the community, Port Promise had to revert back to the original pavement rather than pay for the replacement.</Text>
  <Text Key="ECEBF125">The &lt;b&gt;Modern Development in Conifer Station&lt;/b&gt; Neighborhood Action Plan is now in effect.\n\nThe increase in residents' household bills will feel like a small sacrifice in comparison to the breathtaking advancements we'll all soon be enjoying.\n\nThe apartment block in Conifer Station has already undergone a sophisticated modern face lift with an update to the look of the apartment buildings, as well as a modern renovation to the surrounding sidewalk.</Text>
  <Text Key="D07B293F">Apartment development is a sound investment, but without proper upkeep, things tend to degrade to their outdated state. Now without funding, they will stay outdated.</Text>
  <Text Key="E36C9396">The modern updates made to the apartment block were so strikingly executed, we figured why stop there? We’ve put a portion of the Conifer Station’s Modern Development funding towards beautifying a number of the neighborhood’s residential structures as well. This is truly a grass rooves initiative.\n\nAnd for our neighborhood's final modern update, we contracted a local Master Crafter to weld striking art pieces encircling our beloved Conifer Towers. These pieces commemorate our native ponderosa pine!</Text>
  <Text Key="F1FBDA4E">It was a valiant attempt by the community to keep Conifer Station thriving. However, a Repeal is a Repeal, and we have no choice but to return Conifer Station to its previous state.</Text>
  <Text Key="35163927">The community’s generous donations have paid for a striking remodel to the exterior or our historic Conifer Station! As part of the remodel, we have also modernized a section of its railway overpass as a juxtaposition of where we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; vs. where we &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt;. Residents can now walk freely up the stairs to enjoy the newly refurbished interpretive site. How you interpret this site is wholly up to your personal interpretation.</Text>
  <Text Key="A4A9BF35">Because of the Repeal of &lt;b&gt;Modern Initiatives in Conifer Station&lt;/b&gt;, the historic railway has been returned to its previous, rickety condition.</Text>
  <Text Key="7BDFC7BD">The streets just got brighter! For the next round of changes for &lt;b&gt;Modern Development in Conifer Station&lt;/b&gt; we’ve replaced the crusty pavement of our center streets with a marvelous sunflower mosaic. Residents of Conifer Station are sure to have more spring in their step while treading on this floral treasure.</Text>
  <Text Key="6C331EE7">Because of the Repeal of &lt;b&gt;Modern Development in Conifer Station&lt;/b&gt; we can no longer afford the upkeep of our lovely sunflower streets. We are now back to basic roads.</Text>
  <Text Key="1BD34B92">Thanks to everyone who voted for &lt;b&gt;Modern Development in Grims Quarry&lt;/b&gt;, this neighborhood will finally begin to realize its full potential! Using the gracious contributions from our community, residents will be able to enjoy seeing developments throughout the week.\n\nIn fact, in the Board of N.A.P. has already funneled some of the increased development budget into eco chic upgrades for many of Grims Quarry’s apartment buildings!</Text>
  <Text Key="A1E75B3A">Since the Repeal of &lt;b&gt;Modern Development in Grims Quarry&lt;/b&gt;, funding is quickly running out. The eco chic makeover of the apartment buildings will have to be the first thing to go...</Text>
  <Text Key="BC620616">The eco chic exteriors on the apartment buildings were starting to make our tired old residential buildings look well… old and tired. So we’ve taken the remainder of the community’s contributions and have applied an eco chic upgrade to many of the home residences of Grims Quarry as well.\n\nThis concludes all planned modern upgrades funded by the &lt;b&gt;Modern Development in Grims Quarry&lt;/b&gt; Neighborhood Action Plan.\n\nIsn’t it pretty!</Text>
  <Text Key="693FC31F">Without enough funding, the residential buildings have quickly reverted back to their old, tired state.</Text>
  <Text Key="65E92315">Feast your eyes on the contemporary updates that have been made to our neighborhood’s crowning jewel, Grims Quarry. The old rusty chain link fence that used to welcome its visitors has been replaced with a &lt;i&gt;stylish&lt;/i&gt; rusty fence made from upcycled cuts of historic ship metal.\n\nWe’re also unveiling the quarry’s limestone tribute art piece, featuring two ridiculously enormous saw blades, polished to perfection with fine organic silk.</Text>
  <Text Key="EBC1794F">Funding has officially dried up, much like Grims Quarry. Sadly, we've had to return the modern fencing and saw blade art piece back to where they came from. It was nice while it lasted.</Text>
  <Text Key="68E0ADF4">The beautification of Grims Quarry continues with an absurdly stunning upgrade to our previously cracked central streets. Residents can now enjoy walking and biking on a veritable work of modern art.\n\nHow the contractors were able to pull off this level of detail and artistry within just a couple days will remain a mystery. But hey, we’ll take it!</Text>
  <Text Key="800FC6E4">Say bye-bye to those pretty swirly roads! With the decrease in funding, we can now only afford plain, boring asphalt.</Text>

  <Text Key="745FC41A">As a player, each Community Space contains four individual lots within it. The Active lot is the one that currently appears in the world, but all four lots can be accessed in Build Mode via the Venue Info.</Text>
  <Text Key="931654B5">Community Spaces are a new lot type that allow Sims to congregate as a community and affect change. These shared spaces have the power to transform through actions Sims take on the Community Voting Board. Each Community Space can become a Community Garden, a Marketplace, or a Maker Space!</Text>
  <Text Key="2B2C3A55">Community Spaces</Text>
  <Text Key="02806750">An Industrial Eco Footprint brings smog, pollution, and increased utility production of Atmospheric Water Generators and Power Generators. Fires of all kinds and trash plants all contribute to an Industrial Eco Footprint.</Text>
  <Text Key="440477E4">Neighborhoods now have a unique Eco Footprint. Landscaping, objects and the actions of the entire community push a neighborhood's Eco Footprint to become Green, Neutral, or Industrial. </Text>
  <Text Key="B0E11C29">A Green Eco Footprint brings fresh air, a healthy atmosphere, and increased utility production of Solar Panels, Wind Turbines and Dew Collectors. Lots with plenty of trees, garden plants and energy efficient objects contribute to a Green Eco Footprint. Community Policies promoting gardening and Green Initiatives also help! </Text>
  <Text Key="E8AD3F22">Eco Footprint</Text>
  <Text Key="4AFB152C">The Candle Making Table uses Bits and Pieces, as well as dyes and wax to create various shapes and colors. Purchase or use fresh wax gathered from soy plants to create your candle. At high levels, some candles can change your Sim’s moods.</Text>
  <Text Key="B41B2CFE">You can also make fizzy juice using the Juice Fizzer. The Juice Fizzer does not use Bits and Pieces, but it uses ingredients such as fruit. You'll first need to load the ingredients, and then start the fizzing process. When it's done, you'll retrieve your beverage from the machine. Using more ingredients will create a multi-pack of beverages. It will cost a few more Simoleons, but will be cheaper per bottle to produce.</Text>
  <Text Key="11288C16">When you use the Recycler, you will obtain a new currency called Bits and Pieces. Bits and Pieces are needed to make things in the Fabricator. You can always hover over the Household Funds or the Recycler to see how many Bits and Pieces you have.</Text>
  <Text Key="2F40FAC4">Crafting new objects in Eco Lifestyle allows you to take old things and make them new again. The first step is to use a Recycler to recycle anything you have in your Sim's Inventory or the Household Inventory. Then, take the Bits and Pieces you've obtained from the Recycler, and create new items using the Fabricator. Diving in a Dumpster is a great way to find things you can use in the Recycler!</Text>
  <Text Key="E7A6996C">Click on the Fabricator to begin crafting an item. The picker will give you the choice of what item and what color. To create different colored items, you need to use dyes. Dyes can be purchased, gifted, or found while interacting with other Eco Lifestyle items.\n\nThe Fabrication Skill can be increased by making objects at the Fabricator or Candle Making Table. Leveling up will unlock more recipes for your Sim to create. These items can be made using the Bits and Pieces you receive from the Recycler.</Text>

  <Text Key="A9B0D855">Voting for Green Initiatives and Modern Development Action Plans can literally change what your Sims' neighborhood looks like!\n\nWhile Green Initiatives generally bring more trees and a Green effect on the neighborhood's Eco Footprint, Modern Development plans bring modern visual updates to streets, surrounding buildings, and more.</Text>
  <Text Key="F38B8B79">While the voting period is open, Sims can vote either at their own Mailbox or at a public Community Voting Board. All neighborhoods in Evergreen Harbor have a Voting Board on their street.\n\nDon’t live in Evergreen Harbor? No problem! In addition to using their own Mailbox, Sims can also vote from a Community Voting Board placed at any Venue lot.</Text>
  <Text Key="C9674ACD">There is a new Neighborhood Action Plans section in the Simology Panel (Y) that is quick access to various bits of useful Neighborhood Action Plan information.\n\nYou can see how many &lt;i&gt;Influence Points&lt;/i&gt; your active Sim currently has, what the voting schedule is, and whether or not voting is currently open or closed.\n\nIf voting is currently closed, don’t worry! Voting re-opens and closes on the same days each week. This should give your Sims some time to &lt;i&gt;Check Neighborhood Action Plans&lt;/i&gt; for next week on the Community Voting Board and work on building up their &lt;i&gt;Influence&lt;/i&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="29A00CB0">In order to vote, a Sim needs &lt;i&gt;Influence&lt;/i&gt;. Each vote takes 10 &lt;i&gt;Influence Points&lt;/i&gt; and Sims can place as many votes as their current &lt;i&gt;Influence&lt;/i&gt; affords.\n\nThere are a number of ways your Sim can gain &lt;i&gt;Influence&lt;/i&gt;, including:\n&lt;ul type="circle"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following the rules of an enacted Neighborhood Action Plan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being active in the Civil Designer Career&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting Promoted in any Career&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Positive Introductions with other Sims&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Becoming Friends, Good Friends, and Best Friends with other Sims&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Giving Gifts to other Sims&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mentoring other Sims&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hosting an Event&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
  <Text Key="B56D1887">Neighborhood Action Plans (N.A.P.s for short) are your Sim’s way to have a personal impact on how their neighborhood looks or how their community operates. These can have a variety of effects, ranging from how much Sims in the area are paid for their jobs, to how NPCs behave, to even the neighborhood’s Eco Footprint!\n\nIt’s possible for up to four Neighborhood Action Plans to be active at one time in any residential neighborhood.</Text>
  <Text Key="7D903015">NPC Sims can vote too. If your Sim would like to use NPCs to their advantage, they can rally their cause by interacting with other Sims to &lt;i&gt;Convince to Support&lt;/i&gt; their N.A.P. of choice. \n\nIf a N.A.P. is active that you don’t like or if your Sim would like to enjoy a change of scenery, your Sim always has the right to &lt;i&gt;Petition to Repeal&lt;/i&gt; any active Plan in their neighborhood.\n\nA Repeal takes a little work. In order to successfully repeal an active N.A.P., Sims must successfully &lt;i&gt;Ask for Repeal Signature&lt;/i&gt; from 5 other Sims before the current voting period closes.</Text>
  <Text Key="366ECC6F">&lt;b&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/b&gt;\nTo turn off NPC voting, check off the &lt;b&gt;Enable NPC Voting&lt;/b&gt; Option in the Eco Lifestyle Options Tab\n\n&lt;b&gt;CHEATS&lt;/b&gt;\nShift+Click on any public Community Voting Board or your Sim's Mailbox to access the following cheats:\n&lt;ul type="circle"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instant Enact Neighborhood Action Plan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instant Repeal Neighborhood Action Plan (only available if there is a current active Plan)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give Sim Influence +15&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>

  <Text Key="6A0714F9">There are now a variety of Water and Power utility production objects that can be purchased from Build Mode. Water and Power generated from these objects can be used to help supplement the cost of utilities on Bills. These objects will also allow a Household to operate with utilities when utilities are shut off.</Text>
  <Text Key="01CBB44F">To see if an object will produce or consume utility, hover over an object in the Buy Catalog. The tooltip will indicate if that object has a Power or Water Production/Consumption Rating.\n\nSome Water Production objects are the Atmospheric Water Generator and Dew Collector. Some Power Production objects are the Power Generator, Solar Panel, and Wind Turbine. Certain Lot Traits or build mode objects may also contribute to Water or Power generation or usage.</Text>
  <Text Key="21B3D27E">If a household generates more Power or Water utility than is consumed, excess utility may be sold. This can be done by viewing the Bills and Utilities menu on either the mailbox or the weekly Bills statement.\n\nExcess utility is set to Auto-Sell by default, but it may also be stored for future use.
