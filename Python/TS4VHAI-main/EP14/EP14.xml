  <Text Key="29ADBA82">Excellent Quality Nectar is the best possible Nectar that can be produced. Current Skill Level, Ingredient Quality, and the Skill Level required to craft a bottle of Nectar all impact the quality of each Nectar bottle. To increase the chance of crafting Excellent Nectar, try improving Nectar Making Skill, growing high quality plants for Ingredients, or making sure a Sim is in a good mood while they are crafting.</Text>
  <Text Key="F031F8FA">Make {1.Money} Selling Nectar</Text>
  <Text Key="02C8CA63">Select a bottle of Nectar and select Sell or Drag here to sell in a Sim's Inventory. The Mysterious Rancher who periodically appears around Chestnut Ridge is also willing to buy!\n\nVarious factors impact how much each bottle of Nectar can sell for. To increase the amount of Simoleons earned from each bottle consider the following:\n• Nectar price increases from Not Yet Aged, to Lightly Aged, to Moderately Aged, and peaks at Finely Aged.\n• Nectar price increases from Poor Quality to Normal Quality, and peaks at Excellent Quality. Try using high quality Ingredients to improve the quality of Nectar.\n• Nectars that require more Nectar Making Skill to craft are worth more. Improve Nectar Making Skill to craft more difficult Nectars.\n• The Mysterious Rancher will pay more money for Nectar than selling it regularly will.</Text>
  <Text Key="8655756B">Achieve Level 5 Nectar Making Skill</Text>

Harvest ingredients from a garden or buy them, then choose to Craft Nectar. As your Sim produces Nectar they will level up their Nectar Making Skill.</Text>

Livin' the ranch life at Chestnut Ridge might just be what you've been dreaming of!\n\nFirst take a moment to breathe in the fresh country air - there's nothin' quite like it.\n\nReady to welcome a Horse (or many?) into your home? You can adopt a young Foal and raise it with love and care, or if you're ready for riding, you can welcome an adult Horse too!\n\nThe local ranching community welcomes you with open arms and are ready to help folks of all experience levels, whether you're looking to mount up and ride for the first time or you're ready to bring home the gold at our Equestrian Center competitions.\n\nMaybe you'd prefer to start off small (pun intended) with some Mini Goats and Mini Sheep - both adorable as all get-out!\n\nThe lush soil is ideal for exercising that green thumb of yours and growing the freshest, sweetest fruits and veggies. You might even try your hand at turning your yield into delicious Nectar and, who knows, you may even make a few (or a lot!) of Simoleons by selling a few bottles!</Text>
  <Text Key="F9F53CA9">Getting Started</Text>
  <Text Key="A22535A4">Cute Foals are not the only perk to Breeding Horses. Foals can earn &lt;b&gt;Breedable Traits&lt;/b&gt; that are given just through Breeding.\n\nIf one of the Foals' parents is a Championship Horse, there is a chance the Foal may receive this Trait only through Breeding.\n\nThere are other &lt;b&gt;Traits&lt;/b&gt; such as &lt;b&gt;Curious, Playful, and Hardy&lt;/b&gt; that can only be earned through Breeding. </Text>
  <Text Key="9FBFD3FC">The time has come for your Sim's Mare to have a Foal! Hold your Horses, no need for panic! Your Sim can have a special moment with their Horse during Labor by choosing to &lt;b&gt;Soothe Horse in Labor&lt;/b&gt;. </Text>
  <Text Key="DEA9795A">Horses will need to have a Friendly Relationship to Breed. Although Sims Encourage Breeding to happen between two Horses, the Horses can refuse if there is no positive relationship! The Horses can also refuse if they don't have a high enough Relationship with the Sim who is Encouraging to Breed.\n\nSims will need to be sure to Encourage Socialization between the two Horses that you have interest in Breeding. If Horses are on the same lot, they may also Socialize with each other on their own. Horses will always need to be on the same lot to Socialize with one another. </Text>
  <Text Key="37B436C2">&lt;b&gt;Which Horses can breed?&lt;/b&gt; Sims can breed Adult Stallions or Elder Stallions with Adult Mares. Elder Mares are not able to breed.\n\nFind a Horse's sex and age by hovering over the Horse or opening the Horse's &lt;b&gt;Profile&lt;/b&gt;. To do the latter, select the Horse in the world and go to &lt;b&gt;More Options&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Actions&lt;/b&gt;, and then &lt;b&gt;Open Profile&lt;/b&gt;. For a Horse who is not nearby, you can access the Profile from the &lt;b&gt;Relationship Panel&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="FA11817B">Sims can Breed their Horses and welcome adorable Foals to the Household!\n\nSims must be able to Encourage a Friendly relationship between a Stallion and a Mare that may result in the Mare becoming pregnant with a Foal.</Text>
  <Text Key="B92D1153">Congratulations! You have a Pregnant Mare that will give birth to a Foal.\n\nKeep in mind that while the Mare is Pregnant, she will not be able to be Mounted, Ridden, or be Bred till after the Foal is born.\nYour Mare will also tire more easily and require a bit more Hay to keep her Hunger satisfied since she's eating for two!</Text>
  <Text Key="89BFD4F8">If you're having some trouble getting two Horses to Breed, be sure that the two Horses are on the same lot at the time your Sim will &lt;b&gt;Encourage to Breed&lt;/b&gt;. Make sure the Horses are both awake and within the age requirements with a Friendly Relationship. It's good to make sure your Horse has their Needs taken care of and they are not uncomfortable.\n\nHorses that are already Pregnant will not be able to Breed again till after the Foal is born.\n\nIf a Breeding attempt fails, the Horses may need some time to do their own thing before Breeding again.\n\nHorses will not be able to Breed if there is a Sim Riding them! Let's try to give them needed privacy and &lt;b&gt;Dismount&lt;/b&gt; the Horses first. </Text>

  <Text Key="0C9E1C5A">Spending time with Horses is fun for both, but for the ultimate in solo entertainment, try a Horse Toy! Buy a &lt;b&gt;Hay Now! One Big Ball&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;b&gt;Build Mode&lt;/b&gt; so your Horses can have fun on their own!</Text>
  <Text Key="D1E772F4">While Horses don't require a Bed to sleep, they sure do like it! Assigning Horses to Beds will ensure that they have a place just for them. This is a great way to make designated stalls on your ranch for each of your Horses.</Text>
  <Text Key="CE464DBB">Yes, Horses have to go too! You can pick up your Horses Manure and use it as Fertilizer, but be sure to pay attention to the quality of the Manure. A happy Horse will produce an Outstanding Quality Manure that's excellent for fertilizing while a Horse with low Socialization or discomfort will have a Poor Quality Manure.\n\nIf you want to reap the natural Rancher benefits of Manure, try to make sure your Horse's needs are in excellent condition. You will be able to check the Quality once you pick up the Manure by selecting &lt;b&gt;Put in Inventory&lt;/b&gt; and the bag is placed in your Sim's Inventory. </Text>
  <Text Key="53237680">To keep your Ranch Animals fed, pick up a &lt;b&gt;Hay Now! Animal Feeder&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt;Build Mode&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nRefilling the Animal Feeder costs a bit of Simoleons. Alternatively, refill it with harvested &lt;b&gt;Prairie Grass Hay&lt;/b&gt;, which will reduce Fatigue for Horses that eat it!\n\nThe Feeder holds enough for several meals. If your Sims don't have time, hire a Ranch Hand to take care of it (and more!).</Text>
  <Text Key="EAD137AE">Socializing with your horse is a good way to get to know them better. Socializing is a need that Horses have just like Sims do! Horses come with all sorts of personalities that make some social interactions easier with some horses than others.\n\nAn Aggressive Horse might react negatively more often to Sims and Horses Socializing with them, but don't give up! Give some Horses time and Socialize more with them by using the &lt;b&gt;Talk To&lt;/b&gt; interaction or trying a &lt;b&gt;Horse Care&lt;/b&gt; interaction such as &lt;b&gt;Brush Coat&lt;/b&gt;. </Text>
  <Text Key="6CE5F960">Any good rancher knows that some cold water is the best way to help a Fatigued Horse after a day of training. Get a &lt;b&gt;Water Trough&lt;/b&gt;! Your Livestock might also enjoy lapping up the leftover puddles.\n\nThe Hay Now! Horse Water Trough can be found in Build Mode in the &lt;b&gt;Animals&lt;/b&gt; section of the &lt;b&gt;Outdoors&lt;/b&gt; Category. </Text>

  <Text Key="5173D931">Each Horse can be &lt;b&gt;Purchased&lt;/b&gt; for §1,000 or &lt;b&gt;Rescued&lt;/b&gt; for §250. Due to the environment they came from, rescue Horses will have more difficult Traits, and extra attention and care may be needed.\n\nTo &lt;b&gt;Purchase&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Rescue&lt;/b&gt; a Horse visit the Phone's Home menu and select &lt;b&gt;Call Ranch Animal Exchange&lt;/b&gt;, go to a Computer's Household category, use the &lt;b&gt;Ranch Community Board&lt;/b&gt;, or visit the &lt;b&gt;Equestrian Center&lt;/b&gt; in Chestnut Ridge's New Appaloosa Neighborhood.</Text>
  <Text Key="A76E2495">If you don't start off with a Horse in your Household right out of Create a Sim, there are a variety of ways to acquire a Horse! Two of the main ways are to &lt;b&gt;Purchase&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Rescue&lt;/b&gt;. You can also &lt;b&gt;Breed&lt;/b&gt; Horses. To learn more about &lt;b&gt;Breeding Horses&lt;/b&gt; visit the &lt;b&gt;Horse Breeding Lesson&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nIt is also possible to &lt;b&gt;Sell&lt;/b&gt; a Horse for Simoleons.</Text>
  <Text Key="6E6B2415">Horses can also be &lt;b&gt;Sold&lt;/b&gt; for Simoleons. A Horse's value depends on their Skill Levels, past Competition Performance, quality of care, and age. If a Horse has &lt;b&gt;Champion Genes&lt;/b&gt; this will also increase their value. Selling Horses is a great way to earn a healthy income... if you have quality Horses to back that ambition up.\n\nTo &lt;b&gt;Sell&lt;/b&gt; a Horse visit the Phone's Home menu and select &lt;b&gt;Call Ranch Animal Exchange&lt;/b&gt;, go to a Computer's Household category, use the &lt;b&gt;Ranch Community Board&lt;/b&gt;, or visit the &lt;b&gt;Equestrian Center&lt;/b&gt; in Chestnut Ridge's New Appaloosa Neighborhood.</Text>

  <Text Key="53B48EF3">&lt;b&gt;Horse Riding&lt;/b&gt; can be an activity for enjoyment, a means of travel, or a tool for winning Horse Competitions.

  <Text Key="55C6DB99">The best way to learn the &lt;b&gt;Horse Riding&lt;/b&gt; Skill is to mount up and get riding—whether out for a leisurely ride or actively training a Horse's &lt;b&gt;Agility&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Jumping&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;Endurance&lt;/b&gt; Skills! Anytime a Sim is on a Horse and that Horse is moving, the &lt;b&gt;Horse Riding&lt;/b&gt; Skill is improving!</Text>

  <Text Key="EB91BE13">With so many things to do in Chestnut Ridge, it helps to have one spot with all the information you need!\n\nEach neighborhood has a &lt;b&gt;Ranch Community Board&lt;/b&gt; were you can&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;learn about the town and its residents&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;purchase Ranch Animals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hire a Ranch Hand to help you with your Ranch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pick up odd jobs around town&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;send your Horse to train and compete at the Equestrian Center&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;If you want a Community Board of your own for ultra convenient access, purchase one from the &lt;b&gt;Outdoor Activities&lt;/b&gt; category in &lt;b&gt;Build Mode&lt;/b&gt; and place it on your home lot!</Text>
  <Text Key="415EF21B">A Sim with low &lt;b&gt;Horse Riding&lt;/b&gt; Skill and a Horse with low &lt;b&gt;Agility&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Jumping&lt;/b&gt; Skill can &lt;b&gt;Practice Barrels&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;b&gt;Horse Barrels&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Practice Basic Jumps&lt;/b&gt; on the &lt;b&gt;Horse Jumps&lt;/b&gt;. This gives a small amount of Skill increase for Horses with a smaller amount of Fatigue.\n\nAs a Sim improves their &lt;b&gt;Horse Riding&lt;/b&gt; Skill they can also choose to &lt;b&gt;Intensely Train&lt;/b&gt;. This increases the amount of Skill a Horse is gaining, but also will Fatigue them much faster. Horses who have higher &lt;b&gt;Jumping&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Agility&lt;/b&gt; score also have a more "advanced" option for training on these objects. They can &lt;b&gt;Race Barrels&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Practice Advanced Jumps&lt;/b&gt;, which does the same thing as &lt;b&gt;Intensely Train&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nThese options for improved training technique are great when an experienced Horse rider is trying to train an unskilled Horse or a more skilled Horse is being trained by a Sim who is new to &lt;b&gt;Horse Riding&lt;/b&gt;. </Text>
  <Text Key="656EFFC1">A Horse's &lt;b&gt;Jumping&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Agility&lt;/b&gt; Skills can be trained on the &lt;b&gt;Horse Barrels&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Horse Jumps&lt;/b&gt; training objects. While riding a Horse during training, a Sim's &lt;b&gt;Horse Riding&lt;/b&gt; Skill will also increase on these objects!\n\n&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; When training, a Horse may become Fatigued. At that point, it's probably best to give them a break and train more later! </Text>
  <Text Key="97665CC2">&lt;b&gt;Endurance&lt;/b&gt; Skill is all about how resilient a Horse is! A horse with high Skill in &lt;b&gt;Endurance&lt;/b&gt; will become Fatigued less often, do better at certain &lt;b&gt;Community Jobs&lt;/b&gt; and the Endurance Race, Show Jumping, and Ultimate Horse Championship &lt;b&gt;Competitions&lt;/b&gt;.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Endurance&lt;/b&gt; Skill is built by going for rides. Skill can also be acquired by sending a Horse for training using the &lt;b&gt;Ranch Community Board&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="BDEA782B">Horses have four unique Skills of their own that affect how they interact with Sims and how well they'll perform at Community Jobs and Horse Competitions. These Skills include: &lt;b&gt;Temperament&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Agility&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Jumping&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Endurance&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nAs these Skills improve, a Horse's value will increase, allowing Sims who specialize in Horse Training to make substantial Simoleons from training and selling Horses.\n\nYou can view a Horse's Skill levels by selecting them in a Sim's Relationship Panel at the bottom right of the screen, then choosing "Open Profile."</Text>
  <Text Key="794C0DB3">Horses with high &lt;b&gt;Jumping&lt;/b&gt; Skill love to reach for new heights! They are better at using &lt;b&gt;Horse Jumps&lt;/b&gt;, completing certain &lt;b&gt;Community Jobs&lt;/b&gt;, and performing in the Show Jumping, Endurance Racing, and Ultimate Horse Championship &lt;b&gt;Competitions&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nA Horse's &lt;b&gt;Jumping Skill&lt;/b&gt; is built by training with a &lt;b&gt;Horse Jump&lt;/b&gt;, but it can also be gained by sending a Horse for training using the &lt;b&gt;Ranch Community Board&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="F02D8219">A Sim must be mounted on a Horse to start training with &lt;b&gt;Horse Barrels&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Horse Jumps&lt;/b&gt;. As &lt;b&gt;Horse Riding&lt;/b&gt; Skill develops, a Sim can learn to &lt;b&gt;Direct Horse to&lt;/b&gt; train on their own without a rider. This is a great way for Children to train Horses, since &lt;b&gt;Horse Jumps&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Horse Barrels&lt;/b&gt; are a little too dangerous for them! </Text>
  <Text Key="A2B5B4FC">&lt;b&gt;Horse Jumps&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Horse Barrels&lt;/b&gt; can be found in Build Mode in the &lt;b&gt;Outdoor&lt;/b&gt; Category under &lt;b&gt;Animals&lt;/b&gt;. There are four of these objects in total. For &lt;b&gt;Horse Jumps&lt;/b&gt; there are the Heritage Vintage Horse Jumps and the Champ Certified Horse Jumps objects. For &lt;b&gt;Horse Barrels&lt;/b&gt; there are the Heritage Vintage Horse Barrels and the Champ Certified Horse Barrels objects.\n\nBuild Mode isn't the only place to find these objects. They're also located in the open world in all of Chestnut Ridge's three Neighborhoods.</Text>
  <Text Key="95DF7D78">Horses with high &lt;b&gt;Temperament&lt;/b&gt; Skill buck less often when being ridden and get along more easily with Sims and other Horses. They also perform better at certain &lt;b&gt;Community Jobs&lt;/b&gt; and the Western Pleasure, Show Jumping, and Ultimate Horse Championship &lt;b&gt;Competitions&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nA Horse's &lt;b&gt;Temperament&lt;/b&gt; Skill is built when a Sim cares for and socializes with that Horse.

  <Text Key="D9D784FC">&lt;b&gt;Agility&lt;/b&gt; Skill affects how quickly and easily a Horse can move!

These options will help you collect only the best and leave the rest of the Nectars in the &lt;b&gt;Nectar Rack&lt;/b&gt; to age longer!</Text>
  <Text Key="EDAEF37C">Nectar Aging &amp; Nectar Rack</Text>
  <Text Key="31F95CB6">Different Nectars can be made by a variety of different Ingredients, but did you know that these different Nectars will have different effects on a Sim when drinking them? When you craft a new Nectar check out the Notebook next to the Sim's Phone on the bottom left of the screen. New information on each Nectar type is added here—or you can always wait to see what happens.\n\nJust be sure not to drink too much Nectar! Or do. There are consequences.  </Text>
  <Text Key="0F690A98">But what if you don't want to drink your Nectar? What if you're in it for the Simoleons?\n\nVarious factors impact how much each bottle of Nectar can sell for. To increase the amount of Simoleons earned from each bottle consider the following:\n\n• Nectar price increases from Not Yet Aged, to Lightly Aged, to Moderately Aged, and peaks at Finely Aged.\n\n• Nectar price increases from Poor Quality to Normal Quality, and peaks at Excellent Quality. Try using high quality Ingredients to improve the quality of Nectar.\n\n• Nectars that require more &lt;b&gt;Nectar Making&lt;/b&gt; Skill to craft are worth more. Improve &lt;b&gt;Nectar Making&lt;/b&gt; Skill to craft more difficult Nectars.\n\n• The Mysterious Rancher will pay more money for Nectar than selling it regularly will.</Text>
  <Text Key="7CD920CE">Name your Nectar! This is particularly useful for a Nectar you're saving for a special date. "Lumberjackson Wedding Nectar," as an example. Or if you chose to make Fruit or Berry Nectar you could specify what type of Fruit or Berry you used on the bottle itself. You might end up with "Banana Nectar"!\n\nSimply select a bottle of Nectar and choose the &lt;b&gt;Name&lt;/b&gt; interaction.</Text>
  <Text Key="F7913328">You can store, pour, or sell your Nectar. See the &lt;b&gt;Nectar Aging &amp; Nectar Rack Lesson&lt;/b&gt; to learn more about storing Nectar and we'll cover Selling later in this Lesson. For now, let's talk about serving Nectar.\n\nEach bottle of Nectar starts off corked and has four servings within it. When you choose to Pour 1, 2, 3, or 4 Servings from the bottle you'll uncork the bottle, opening it. At this point, it won't age further and it will have a limited time before it Spoils. Opening a bottle also drastically decreases the Nectar's sell value.</Text>
  <Text Key="3A4DD119">When Nectar is first crafted it is Not Yet Aged. If the bottle isn't opened, it'll age slowly over time becoming first Lightly Aged, then Moderately Aged, until it reaches its peak at Finely Aged. As a Nectar ages it increases in sale value.\n\nYou can hover over a Nectar Bottle to see how aged a bottle currently is in the Hovertip. </Text>
  <Text Key="F2BCD72E">Some Sims (we're talking about you Snobs and Foodies) prefer to only drink the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; Nectars, so what improves a Nectar's quality?\n\nCurrent Skill Level, Ingredient Quality, and the Skill Level required to craft a bottle of Nectar all impact the quality of each Nectar bottle. To increase the chance of crafting Excellent Nectar, try improving &lt;b&gt;Nectar Making&lt;/b&gt; Skill, growing high quality plants for Ingredients, or making sure a Sim is in a good mood while they are crafting.</Text>
  <Text Key="4AF6DF8C">Nectar Bottles</Text>
  <Text Key="F5F8449B">After you select what type of Nectar you want to craft, your Sim will get to work! While using a &lt;b&gt;Nectar Maker&lt;/b&gt; your Sim will gain &lt;b&gt;Nectar Making&lt;/b&gt; Skill. This Skill helps to improve the quality of your Nectar, the speed at which you use the &lt;b&gt;Nectar Maker&lt;/b&gt;, and unlocks new Nectar types for you to craft!\n\nNectar bottles that have been fully crafted will be picked up by your Sim and put into their personal Inventory.</Text>
  <Text Key="027A5DD9">Before you can &lt;b&gt;Craft Nectar&lt;/b&gt;, you're going to need Ingredients! Basic Ingredients can be purchased on the &lt;b&gt;Nectar Maker&lt;/b&gt; itself or purchased at Chestnut Ridge's Bits &amp; Bales Mercantile store in the New Appaloosa Neighborhood.\n\nThe &lt;i&gt;best ingredients&lt;/i&gt;, however, are grown in gardens! Seeds can be purchased through Planter Boxes found in Build Mode or from a Computer. These purchased seeds will then be available in your Sim's inventory. Improving in &lt;b&gt;Gardening Skill&lt;/b&gt;, taking care of your Plants, and planting better seeds from your Harvest will result in even better Ingredients that will make your Nectar the best it can be!</Text>
  <Text Key="1E6B8C74">When you use the &lt;b&gt;Nectar Maker&lt;/b&gt; as often as we do it tends to get dirty! You can tell because it will look grungy. A dirty &lt;b&gt;Nectar Maker&lt;/b&gt; will impact the quality of your Nectar, so you certainly want to keep it clean. Select the &lt;b&gt;Nectar Maker&lt;/b&gt; and choose &lt;b&gt;Clean Nectar Maker&lt;/b&gt; to scrub away all the grime. Nobody wants to drink yucky, dirty Nectar!</Text>
  <Text Key="7432DD49">How do you know what Ingredients you need? Select the &lt;b&gt;Nectar Maker&lt;/b&gt; and choose &lt;b&gt;Craft Nectar&lt;/b&gt;. The menu that appears will tell you what Ingredients are needed, what Nectars you can craft, and what &lt;b&gt;Nectar Making&lt;/b&gt; Skill is needed to craft them! When you have the right Ingredients and the right Skill Level, the option to craft that particular Nectar type will become available.</Text>
  <Text Key="FF120564">The &lt;b&gt;Nectar Maker&lt;/b&gt; object allows Sims to both level up their &lt;b&gt;Nectar Making&lt;/b&gt; Skill and also craft delectable bottles of Nectar—in all its glorious varieties.\n\nTo get started, the Rootin' Fruit'n Nectar Maker can be purchased in Build Mode in the &lt;b&gt;Hobbies &amp; Skills&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Outdoor Activities&lt;/b&gt; categories.</Text>

  <Text Key="78EA815E">&lt;b&gt;Nectar Making&lt;/b&gt; combines the subtle art of extracting essential flavors from a wide variety of ingredients with the not-so-subtle art of smashing those ingredients to a pulp.
