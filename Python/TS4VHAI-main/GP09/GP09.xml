  <Text Key="26AB0BFA">As {0.SimFirstName} explores the maze of pathways in the cave, {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the feeling that {M0.he}{F0.she}'s being watched. Subtle growling emanates from the darkness. Suddenly, a large creature leaps from the shadows, snapping its sharp teeth! It bites down on {0.SimFirstName}'s hand and {M0.he}{F0.she} quickly shakes the creature off and retreats for the exit. {0.SimFirstName}'s wound is minor but {M0.he}{F0.she}'s shaken by what happened.</Text>
  <Text Key="F8B3FEDC">{0.SimFirstName} explores the maze of pathways in the cave, eventually arriving at a large opening. Water trickles down the mossy walls and pools up on the muddy floor. As {M0.he}{F0.she} moves forward, {M0.he}{F0.she} finds {M0.himself}{F0.herself} sinking in the mud. Every effort to pull {M0.himself}{F0.herself} free leads to feeling more stuck. After spending every bit of {M0.his}{F0.her} energy, {0.SimFirstName} is finally free and makes {M0.his}{F0.her} way to the exit, exhausted and ready for a long rest.</Text>
  <Text Key="B3A8EA9B">{0.SimFirstName} confidently explores the winding pathways throughout the cave. Eventually, {M0.he}{F0.she} heads for the exit... but can't find it!

  <Text Key="0B431C27">{0.SimFirstName} explores a dimly lit area of the cave.

Ha ha!" he bellowed. {0.SimFirstName} is horribly embarrassed...</Text>
  <Text Key="087D60BE">While exploring the cave, {0.SimFirstName} comes upon a crying child. "Help! Where's my mother? She was supposed to be back by now..." {0.SimFirstName} picks up the child and begins the search for her mother. After checking numerous tunnels, the two eventually came upon the child's mother. She's trapped under fallen debris! {0.SimFirstName} carefully lifts the heavy stones and rescues her. {0.SimFirstName} is a hero! The mother thanks {M0.him}{F0.her} and offers some credits in appreciation!</Text>
  <Text Key="AB38EBFE">After stumbling in the darkness of the winding cave tunnels, {0.SimFirstName} reaches a large, open area with light shining down from above.

It's beautiful and fills {M0.him}{F0.her} with wonder and inspiration.</Text>

  <Text Key="DD573666">The small crew of the &lt;i&gt;Millennium Falcon&lt;/i&gt; enters lightspeed and heads to Coruscant. The entire planet is one giant city! “Our contact is meeting us on Level 5127...” said Hondo. The &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; lands on an open platform.\n\nHondo, Chewbacca, and {0.SimFirstName} exit the ship and meet with the contact. “Pintu, my friend! We’ve brought you the lichen, now let’s make the deal so we may be on our way!” declares Hondo. “It took you too long; I’ll only pay half.” grumbles Pintu. </Text>
  <Text Key="A12F00F5">“That wasn’t the deal!” barks Hondo. As tensions rise, Pintu’s bodyguards move closer. {0.SimFirstName} jumps in quickly to accept the offer despite Hondo’s tantrum. Oga wouldn’t be happy if a small disagreement resulted in losing a business contact.</Text>
  <Text Key="B03EE5B8">“I suppose I can overlook your tardiness this once. Send my regards to Oga. Here’s a little extra to make sure she doesn’t hear about our little disagreement...” Pintu mutters. “Always a pleasure, my friend!” exclaims Hondo as the crew scurries to the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; with their loot. The ship rises up through the levels and charts a course for Batuu. </Text>
  <Text Key="5DC0D506">“Stay out of this! Here’s the money. Don’t push your luck while you’re still able to walk out of here on two feet!” shouts Pintu. Hondo mutters some choice phrases under his breath and the group returns to the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; to chart a course for Batuu.</Text>

  <Text Key="4CA686ED">“Ah, there’s no shame in that! Live to fight another day, or in your case, live to run another day!” teases Hondo. The crew hurries to load the remaining crate and lifts off. The ground troopers open fire on the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; but the deflector shields hold true. As they race away, the TIE echelon pursues them.</Text>
  <Text Key="F4042835">{0.SimFirstName} produces a blaster and begins firing at the First Order stormtroopers. Chewbacca fires from cover while Hondo loads the remaining crate.

  <Text Key="5F7F9333">{0.SimFirstName} produces a thermal detonator, activates it, and throws. “YES!” cheers Hondo as the devastating device hurls through the air. It lands next to the First Order transport and explodes, destroying the vehicle and propelling nearby stormtroopers into the air.\n\nThe small crew swiftly pushes the final crate onto the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; and take off. The ground troopers open fire on the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; but the deflector shields hold true. As they race away, the TIE echelon pursues them.</Text>
  <Text Key="0C2DDBDE">“Hello, my friends! Not to worry, we’re here on official business on behalf of Lt. Agnon! We have identification here.” Hondo says as he elbows {0.SimFirstName} who hands over the fake ID card. “Wait here while we verify.” the stormtrooper directs. As the troopers examine the card, the small crew quietly slips into the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; and take off. “Hey! Come back here!” yells the stormtrooper. They all open fire on the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; but the deflector shields hold true. As they race away, the TIE echelon pursues them. </Text>
  <Text Key="9B6892C4">Fire at TIE echelon</Text>
  <Text Key="E579A83A">The &lt;i&gt;Millennium Falcon&lt;/i&gt; rises above the Surabat vicinity in an attempt to flee the First Order assault. {0.SimFirstName} does {M0.his}{F0.her} best to dodge the barrage of laser fire. The crew is going to need to get the TIE echelon off their backs soon or they’ll never leave Batuu!</Text>

  <Text Key="A59585E1">The &lt;i&gt;Millennium Falcon&lt;/i&gt; flies low to the ground while the TIE echelon pursues them. {0.SimFirstName} steers toward the forest of towering spires. “Good idea, they’ll never find us after we’ve hit a spire and exploded into millions of pieces!” shouts Hondo. The &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; twists and turns, weaving between the petrified spires while the TIE echelon follows closely behind. </Text>
  <Text Key="A5F6C2DA">Head to Coruscant</Text>
  <Text Key="6AD4FBD8">Chewbacca moves to the main gun and fires on the TIE echelon. The imposing ship dodges the first few shots but one laser hits their wing. The TIE echelon begins to smoke and makes an emergency landing. The &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; quickly pulls up and exits Batuu’s atmosphere.</Text>
  <Text Key="E81E4C8F">Chewbacca moves to the main gun and fires at the spires. Chunks of petrified trees fly everywhere. The base of one spire fractures and collapses into another spire. A chain reaction of falling spires careens toward the TIE echelon which diverts to avoid the chaos. The &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; quickly pulls up and exits Batuu’s atmosphere.</Text>
  <Text Key="32288CD6">Fly to Takodana</Text>
  <Text Key="C10B7F2C">“Did I ever tell you about the time I sold empty crates? Things got messy when the buyer asked to inspect their product. Even I had a hard time talking my way out of that one! Ha! Well, let’s meet my associate on Kessel and pick up my off-the-books spice.”\nThe small crew arrives on Kessel. Chewbacca and {0.SimFirstName} load the containers as Hondo chit-chats with his associate. They bid farewell and Hondo boards the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt;. “RAWWRRR!” roars Chewbacca. “Do I trust my associate? Of course not! But business is business!”</Text>
  <Text Key="D937A2EE">{0.SimFirstName}’s droid quickly moves to a control panel and triggers the doors to close, locking away the pirates. “Sometimes the path to profit is the simplest one!,” Hondo exclaims. The group collects as much loot as they can carry and return to the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="181F7BF8">“Where’s your sense of adventure? I’m sure we could take them… if we properly armed ourselves.” teases Hondo. “You’re right, you’re right. I’m a legitimate businessman and we should finish our legitimate business!” The crew continues to Takodana and exchanges the spice for a healthy sum of credits.</Text>
  <Text Key="41BA65C6">“That was thrilling, and profitable! Now let’s finish the job we started, my friend!” The crew flies to Takodana and meets with the buyer. Hondo exchanges the spice for a healthy sum of credits. “Ah, the only thing better than credits is more loot to keep them company!”</Text>
  <Text Key="81CA0CA8">Hondo hands over a bag of credits “Here’s your share, my friend. What was it we agreed to? An 80-20 split?” {0.SimFirstName} gives him a no-nonsense look. “Good, good! I’m impressed with your tenacity. Let’s make it 70-30. Ha ha!”</Text>

  <Text Key="BDD1183F">Boom! The &lt;i&gt;Millennium Falcon&lt;/i&gt; shudders as it’s pelted with laser blasts. “Pirates!” shouts Hondo, “But how could they have known? That rat associate must have sold me out!” Boom! Another shot shakes the ship. “We’re not going to outrun them unless you’re confident enough to fly into that asteroid field!”</Text>
  <Text Key="3B2C147B">Investigate Ship</Text>
  <Text Key="1C55E9FD">{0.SimFirstName} steers into the asteroid field with the help of {M0.his}{F0.her} droid on navigation. The &lt;i&gt;Millennium Falcon&lt;/i&gt; fires back at the ship while it weaves through the asteroids with ease. “Don’t you scratch my ship!” shouts Hondo. “RAAWWWRR!” Chewbacca adds. “Yes, fine… Chewie’s ship. Don’t scratch Chewie’s ship.” \n\nThe pirates pursue the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; into the field but smash the side of their ship into an asteroid and begin careening out of control. The chase appears to be over. Should the crew continue their mission or investigate the wreck?</Text>

  <Text Key="C81E0266">Chewbacca flies the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; in a loop and positions the ship over the pirates. {0.SimFirstName} takes aim and fires. Boom!

The &lt;i&gt;Millennium Falcon&lt;/i&gt; docks aside the mangled ship and the crew enter.\n\nUpon entering the ship a hail of blaster fire unleashes on the group. They take cover behind a stack of nearby crates. The blaster fire stops and {0.SimFirstName} uses this moment to take action.</Text>
  <Text Key="921096A8">Pew Pew Pew! The rain of blaster fire overwhelms Hondo, Chewbacca, and {0.SimFirstName}. The three turn and race back into the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt;. “Some prizes aren’t worth the fight. Let’s focus on our other business!” yells Hondo as they detach from the wreck.</Text>
  <Text Key="0D661BF7">{0.SimFirstName} pulls out a blaster and dives into action. Blue stun rings fly out and hit pirate after pirate until they’re all unconscious on the floor. Hondo’s jaw hangs in amazement, “We’re going to have to do this again! I didn't know you had it in you, my friend! Absolutely stunning!” \n\nChewbacca, Hondo, and {0.SimFirstName} collect as much loot as they can carry and return to the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="631AC433">{0.SimFirstName} is piloting the TIE echelon through space when suddenly, two Resistance fighters appear out of hyperspace.

Repairs will be required and Lt. Agnon will be severely disappointed.</Text>
  <Text Key="59507924">As the TIE echelon explores, a group of aggressive pirate vessels ambush the First Order ship. They board the echelon and take the crew prisoner. The Quarren pirate leader forces {0.SimFirstName} to send an all clear message, clearing the way for a large smuggling operation. "It's been a pleasure doing business with you!" laughs the captain as he opens fire on the echelon's controls before leaving. {0.SimFirstName} makes some hasty repairs and pilots the damaged TIE echelon back to Batuu.
