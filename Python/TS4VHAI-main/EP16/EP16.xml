  <Text Key="E90AB5B6">Get to know what &lt;B&gt;Turn-Ons&lt;/B&gt; or &lt;B&gt;Turns-Offs&lt;/B&gt; you have towards each other and work towards improving yourselves. I can't wave a magic wand and instantly make each of you attractive...but not everything is set in stone! Become more skilled in activities that attract your partner or even just change your wardrobe to make the difference.</Text>
  <Text Key="1D3F00EC">You may find there are particular &lt;B&gt;Turn-Ons&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;Turn-Offs&lt;/B&gt; that don't seem to resonate with you anymore. When this happens, no worries! Just use the &lt;B&gt;Change Sim&lt;/B&gt; action on the &lt;B&gt;Dresser&lt;/B&gt; and you can be as loosey-goosey as you want with your particular desires.</Text>
  <Text Key="5B925DA8">I can imagine you may find all the possibilities of &lt;B&gt;Turn-Ons&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;Turn-Offs&lt;/B&gt; quite confusing. It may be difficult to tease out just what an attractive quality means. If you are confused, try to study more about each &lt;B&gt;Turn-On&lt;/B&gt; or &lt;B&gt;Turn-Off&lt;/B&gt; within the &lt;I&gt;Change Sim&lt;/I&gt; menu on the &lt;B&gt;Dresser&lt;/B&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="A54483A7">The first step is &lt;I&gt;Knowing&lt;/I&gt; if your partner is attracted to you. You can start by &lt;B&gt;Asking About Attraction Level&lt;/B&gt; in the &lt;I&gt;Learn More... Category under Relationship&lt;/I&gt; or by &lt;B&gt;Explaining Attraction Level&lt;/B&gt; to disseminate your feelings towards them. You might find your attraction towards each other is mismatched, but that's okay! That's why we are here today!</Text>

  <Text Key="226B3C2D">This is a healthy argument you two are having. I am so pleased to see it. We are making such momentous progress. Happiness is just a therapy appointment away.</Text>

  <Text Key="0AF328C3">If you work on your &lt;B&gt;Romantic Satisfaction&lt;/B&gt; hard enough, you might find your &lt;B&gt;Romantic Relationship&lt;/B&gt; trending in a positive direction without having to even try. However, if you find yourselves unsatisfied you might find your &lt;B&gt;Romantic Relationship&lt;/B&gt; falling apart faster than you thought possible. I hope I am outlining just how important &lt;B&gt;Romantic Satisfaction&lt;/B&gt; can be in your relationship.</Text>
  <Text Key="8B93B6AB">&lt;B&gt;Romantic Satisfaction&lt;/B&gt; can be different between the two of you. For instance, you might feel &lt;B&gt;Very Unsatisfied&lt;/B&gt; in the relationship while your partner feels as happy as a clam. Try to &lt;B&gt;Ask about Romantic Satisfaction&lt;/B&gt; in the &lt;I&gt;Learn More... Category under Relationship&lt;/I&gt; to know more about how you two feel about where things are.</Text>
  <Text Key="3A8A302B">Have you discussed your &lt;B&gt;Romantic Boundaries&lt;/B&gt; with one another? We all have different expectations from one another. If we don't make those known, we might find our boundaries being violated, which greatly affects &lt;B&gt;Romantic Satisfaction&lt;/B&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="FB1598B7">What I would recommend is learning your partner's &lt;B&gt;Romance Style&lt;/B&gt;. You may find your partner expects more &lt;B&gt;Physical Intimacy&lt;/B&gt; or perhaps &lt;B&gt;Affection&lt;/B&gt;. Once you've learned these desires, don't forget to DO what they expect! Relationships are all about give and take!</Text>

  <Text Key="2B3727DA">If you desire a &lt;B&gt;Wholesome Dynamic&lt;/B&gt;, try spending some quality time together. For instance, try &lt;B&gt;Cooking Together&lt;/B&gt; every once in a while or &lt;B&gt;Plan a Social Event&lt;/B&gt; with your partner. I know you two can do it!</Text>
  <Text Key="A079C173">If you are not happy with the current dynamic of your relationship, try having a conversation with your partner about it! Try to &lt;B&gt;Ask to Work on Romance Dynamic&lt;/B&gt;. If you both agree to it, you might find it easier to change the dynamic than you would have otherwise.</Text>

  <Text Key="2B335CC0">Practice makes perfect! You have the ability to improve your skills in &lt;B&gt;Romance&lt;/B&gt; or &lt;B&gt;Charisma&lt;/B&gt;! You may even just talk to yourself in the mirror if all else fails. Becoming more socially skilled can do wonders for increasing your romantic comings and goings.</Text>
  <Text Key="B2EA4471">Pay attention to the discussion at hand. If you are listening closely to your partner you may be able know when the conversation has become &lt;B&gt;Unpleasant&lt;/B&gt; or &lt;B&gt;Awkward&lt;/B&gt;. Sometimes you just have to step away from each other and try again at another time.</Text>
  <Text Key="CDE137A8">It's best to make sure you are being romantic at the right moments. If either of you are in a bad mood, you might not find your romantic gestures going over too well. If either of you are feeling &lt;B&gt;Flirty&lt;/B&gt;, though, then be proactive! Flirt like there is no tomorrow!</Text>
  <Text Key="5EE94BAF">There are many different factors to having good romantic socialization with your partner! &lt;B&gt;Mood&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;Social Skills&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;Attraction&lt;/B&gt;, and &lt;B&gt;Romantic Satisfaction&lt;/B&gt; all can play a part. One might falsely think that a positive response from a romantic partner is somewhat random, but that's not true! So don't just do the same things over and over hoping for success, be mindful of everything that is happening in your experience!</Text>

  <Text Key="0B6D4556">{0.SimFirstName} tells the client they won't go into that subject. The client is unhappy that nobody will disclose the specifics to them; they believe they are being kept in the dark about a significant secret.</Text>

  <Text Key="261BE4D5">The client makes a diplomatic choice and decides to move on from the situation. The next day their partner surprises them with an impromptu date to make up for it!</Text>
  <Text Key="CECA9A5A">Seeing as the couple appears desperate, {0.SimFirstName} decides to stay back a while and help them sort out their problems. {0.SimFirstName} ends up leaving later than normal with no resolve whatsoever.</Text>

  <Text Key="B4F686CB">So much for romance! The client expresses their confusion, as they hoped you would steer them down the opposite path. You are a Romance Consultant for Cupid's Sake!</Text>
  <Text Key="A840E8DE">A strange decision, but one that might work. The client acknowledges that sometimes a vacation from romance is much needed. They're glad you took their concerns seriously.</Text>
  <Text Key="07C05AEA">{0.SimFirstName} offers insight on how taking chances in love can pay off nicely. Sadly, the client disagrees, stating that the main concern in this case appears to be death.</Text>
  <Text Key="0A2D2313">The client is moved to tears, fear nearly kept them from experiencing the joys that love can bring.</Text>
  <Text Key="BADA585D">Before the client musters the courage to approach their colleague, it seems that a peer has already done so. They observe the events from a distance and are discouraged by what they see.</Text>
  <Text Key="76E82934">The client approaches their crush and asks them out on a date, all fired up with newfound confidence. They are met with an enthusiastic response and end the day feeling triumphant.</Text>
  <Text Key="8A1D5528">Following {0.SimFirstName}'s advice, the client approaches HR with what seems to be a harmless inquiry. The company provides them with guidelines regarding a strict no-dating policy and a keen side-eye for the remainder of the day.</Text>
  <Text Key="17098325">The client seeks out HR first and questions the policy on dating in the workplace. To their surprise, it is not forbidden! They just need to sign a 15 page agreement disclosing all and any information regarding the relationship. A win is a win!</Text>
  <Text Key="8753137C">The museum is unusually crowded, and it appears that several school field trips are taking place on the same day. There isn't much opportunity for romance and the couple ends up feeling disappointed.</Text>
  <Text Key="30F54749">Ah, there's something about staring at a work of art that elevates the mood. By the end of the evening, the two have become practically inseparable from one another.</Text>
  <Text Key="6E572D81">What a catastrophe! The client's date unexpectedly and totally stands them up. Perhaps the setting for their first date was a little strange...</Text>
  <Text Key="37359568">Success! The client and their date end up dancing the night away at their favorite spot, losing track of time. They both exclaim over how much fun they've had and decide to do it again soon.</Text>
  <Text Key="DD9073E7">What's an app? The client can hardly use Social Bunny and is utterly bewildered by the suggestion. They're not feeling sophisticated enough to date using a phone.</Text>
  <Text Key="937152AA">What a fantastic idea! The client is ready to move into the modern world and embrace dating in all its forms. While {0.SimFirstName} takes the time to explain how it works, a match is made!</Text>
  <Text Key="497FD026">Not exactly what the client wanted to hear - since nothing has happened thus far, why carry on in this direction? {0.SimFirstName} attempts to reframe the client's argument but it falls flat.</Text>
  <Text Key="0A50CB6F">While disappointed, the client understands that great things can take time. They worry that switching gears will throw them off their path to the perfect union.</Text>

  <Text Key="21A035F9">The third category of Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs are Romance Styles.\n\nThese are the different ways Sims can give and receive love. These Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs don’t affect Attraction levels. Instead, they control how various types of romance contribute to each Sim’s individual Romantic Satisfaction—not all Sims feel the same way about all forms of romance after all! (See the Romantic Satisfaction lesson)</Text>
  <Text Key="10470BD8">How does one Sim know what another Sim finds attractive? Well, by asking them! Select another Sim, choose the “Relationship” category, then choose “Ask about…Attraction” interactions to find out the various Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs of other Sims.\n\nLikewise, the way to know another Sim’s overall Attraction level is by asking. Select another Sim, choose the “Relationship” category then the “Learn More” category, and finally choose “Ask for Attraction Level.”\n\nSims may be able to make themselves more attractive by avoiding a partner’s Turn-Offs and meeting their Turn-Ons—for example, by changing hair color or cultivating new Skills—but some Sim couples may simply have to put in extra effort or call it quits if Attraction grows to be unmanageable!</Text>
  <Text Key="DDA5032D">Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs are set in Create a Sim and determine how attracted Sims are to each other. Sims can be attracted to physical attributes (like hair or outfit color) or their personality and characteristics. Sims attracted to your Sim will be easier to build romantic relationships with. Attraction can change as the Sims get to know each other based off of their Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs.</Text>
  <Text Key="C810467B">The Relationship panel on the skewer and the Sim Info panel show the Attraction between two Sims. No Attraction icon will appear on other Sims when your Sim has Neutral Attraction to them or otherwise does not experience Attraction at all.\n\nYour Sim’s individual Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs are listed in the Simology panel. Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs can be changed at any time through Create a Sim.</Text>
  <Text Key="620CC3B1">Sims will be attracted to each other at different levels of intensity:\n\n• Very Attracted\n• Attracted\n• Neutral\n• Unattracted\n• Very Unattracted\n\nAttraction level is determined by how many Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs are being met and will affect Sims in various ways: Sims will prefer to socialize with Sims they are attracted to. Sims are also more likely to accept romantic interaction from Sims they find attractive. The opposite is also true: Sims are less likely to socialize with Sims they find unattractive and less likely to accept romance from those Sims.</Text>
  <Text Key="0D29121D">Depending on their Physical Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs, a Sim may experience instant Attraction to a potential romantic interest. However, the story doesn’t end there!\n\nAs your Sim gains knowledge about another Sim, Attraction can go up or down depending on Personality Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Learning new personal information such as Traits, Skills, or even financial status can significantly change the Attraction level your Sim feels toward another.\n\nSims feel Attraction based on their most recent knowledge. If your Sim is turned off by Nature activities and meets someone with low Gardening skill, that Turn-Off won’t really do anything. However, if that other Sim later builds up to high Gardening skill and your Sim finds out, the Turn-Off will trigger and potentially lower your Sim’s Attraction level to the unlucky gardener.</Text>
  <Text Key="6C90E670">At any time, you can toggle between your Sim experiencing Attraction for all Sims that match their romantic attraction, or only for Sims with whom they share a romantic relationship. Select your Sim then choose “Disable Attraction" or change back by choosing “Enable Attraction.”</Text>
  <Text Key="8DF93B86">To set or change a Sim’s Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs, go to Create a Sim and select the Preferences tab underneath Aspirations. Select the tab with the magnet icon to see the different categories of Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs that make up Attraction. Select any category to set specific Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Each Sim may have up to 50 Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs, and these can be changed at any time through Create a Sim.\n\nThe Attraction level felt toward another Sim is controlled by the Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs set inside the Physical and Personality categories:\n\nPhysical Attraction covers everything seen on a Sim’s outside: fashion choices, clothing color, and hair color. These Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs register immediately when Sims socialize with each other.\n\nPersonality Attraction relates to a Sim's Traits, hobbies, and other aspects of their lives that aren't outwardly apparent. Sims will need to ask potential partners about themselves in order to fully understand how attractive (or unattractive) one Sim is to the other! These Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs have a stronger influence on Attraction between Sims.</Text>
  <Text Key="C22F101D">Unlike the Romance score that is shared between two Sims, Attraction is an individual feeling of one Sim toward another. A Sim may be attracted to someone who does not share the feeling, and Sims in a relationship may find themselves with totally different Attraction levels!\n\nCautious Sims may want to exhaust their knowledge of a potential partner before diving into a commitment!

  <Text Key="1A1F36F6">Turn-ons and Turn-Offs are what attract one Sim to another. The attraction can be towards the Physical or Personality attributes of a Sim and Romance Styles. (See the Attraction lesson for more information)\n\nThe following slides reference what each Turn-On or Turn-Off comprises, such as skills, personality traits, or other personality factors.</Text>
  <Text Key="9D0A7062">&lt;b&gt;Physical Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs&lt;/b&gt;\n\nLooks aren't everything...but they're definitely a conversation starter! Physical Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs between Sims determine the Attraction between two Sims instantly, without having to get to know each other better. Changing outfits or hair color can affect a Sim's Attraction level, so select a Sim, and in the "Relationship" category, choose "Ask about Physical Attraction" to find out what look might catch the eye of the romantic interest.\n\nThe different categories of Physical Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs include:\n• Outfit Color \n• Fashion Type\n• Hair Color</Text>

Choose a &lt;b&gt;Romantic Repair Date&lt;/b&gt; if your Sims have low Romantic Relationship - just not too low - sometimes Sims can have such low Romantic Relationship they won't want to go on a date at that moment.</Text>
  <Text Key="6AD1675A">&lt;b&gt;Creating a Date&lt;/b&gt; allows you to choose from three types of dates: &lt;b&gt;Get To Know You Date, Romantic Date, or a Romantic Repair Date.&lt;/b&gt; Choose activities you want your host Sim to accomplish with their date.</Text>
  <Text Key="A40F140C">If you want to Create a Date, there are a few ways to get started. You can initiate the date by selecting a Sim in the Relationship Panel, select &lt;b&gt;Ask On&lt;/b&gt;, then &lt;b&gt;Ask to Create a Date&lt;/b&gt;. You can also select the Sim you wish to ask out on a date where Ask to Create a Date will appear in the Romance category.\n\nBe sure to watch those &lt;b&gt;Traits!&lt;/b&gt; If you ask a Sim out, they may not always say yes. An &lt;b&gt;Unflirty Sim&lt;/b&gt; might decline a date when asked but higher &lt;b&gt;Romantic Relationship&lt;/b&gt; should help.</Text>
  <Text Key="504DE3C2">Time to get the date started! Your host Sim will be able to accomplish &lt;b&gt;Goals&lt;/b&gt; on the date based on the &lt;b&gt;Activities&lt;/b&gt; chosen for the date. Your Sim can do these &lt;b&gt;Activities&lt;/b&gt; any place on the date venue. Once your host Sim completes their goals, you'll see the date progress. You'll see the date meter along with the timer that shows you the progression of the date.</Text>
  <Text Key="85E6F6B5">Select &lt;b&gt;Activities&lt;/b&gt; you want your Sims to do on the date - this will create goals that will determine if you have a Bronze, Silver, or Gold date. Select a venue that you feel will be best for your date - don't forget that you can switch the venue on your date if you need to! To switch the venue during the date, select your Sims date and choose &lt;b&gt;"Date Actions"&lt;/b&gt;. From there, you can &lt;b&gt;"Ask to Extend Date"&lt;/b&gt; to last longer and &lt;b&gt;"Ask to Change Venue"&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>

  <Text Key="4AF5D4EE">Whether you want to foster the love of your Sims or tear their families apart, &lt;b&gt;Ciudad Enamorada&lt;/b&gt; is brimming with opportunities to do both.\n\nWe all have to start somewhere. Why not try &lt;b&gt;Cupid's Corner&lt;/b&gt;, a Matchmaking app that can help you find your future flame?\n\nFirst dates can be awkward, but love can blossom from the most unlikely pairings when &lt;b&gt;Attraction&lt;/b&gt; is involved! Ask to &lt;b&gt;Create a Date&lt;/b&gt;, pick the activities yourself, and choose one of the many romantic hot spots within the city. For example, &lt;b&gt;Media Naranja Park&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt;Plaza Mariposa&lt;/b&gt; is perfect for a picnic on a &lt;b&gt;Romantic Blanket&lt;/b&gt; or searching for &lt;b&gt;Axolotls&lt;/b&gt; by the pond!\n\nWhile on a date, consider a few of these fun (and even risqué) activities for dates to enjoy! The &lt;b&gt;Who's Up Party Game&lt;/b&gt; is a great alternative to small talk for breaking the ice and can reveal enough about a Sim to change the Attraction levels. Mood not quite right? The &lt;b&gt;García Amor Costume Trunk&lt;/b&gt; can provide a little spice to the sweet and set the tone for a magical night, which may involve a &lt;b&gt;Vibromatic Nuevo heart bed&lt;/b&gt; to shake things up.\n\nAlready in a relationship? How is that going? High &lt;b&gt;Romantic Satisfaction&lt;/b&gt; is key to a good relationship. When both Sims are satisfied in a relationship, the relationship is bound to be strong.\n\nA &lt;b&gt;Romance Dynamic&lt;/b&gt; may develop depending on how a Sim interacts with a Partner! This will affect how a couple interacts with each other, for better or for worse! It's up to you to determine whether you're looking for a heartwarming Wholesome dynamic, or a drama filled Strained dynamic.\n\nSo, when exploring a new relationship, remember these key things: no matter what love story you want to tell, it will be one for ages.</Text>

Here you will have a variety of Sims to &lt;b&gt;Like&lt;/b&gt; who will be saved for later. In each of their profiles you will see a photo of the Sim, their age, their location if they've chosen to share it, and two of their traits.\n\nWhen you see the Sim's traits you may notice that your Sim is attracted to or repelled by this trait, but when these Sims meet in person you may find that attraction is more intricate than just a trait or two. You will also see an option to &lt;b&gt;Refresh&lt;/b&gt; the Sims available in your &lt;b&gt;Matches&lt;/b&gt; page. After you've done this once you will need to wait some time before you'll be able to refresh again.</Text>

You will be able to select two traits from your Sim to highlight to other Sims and take a selfie that shows off your Sim.\n\nSelfies are a great way to display some personality for your Sim, but you might need to work on your &lt;b&gt;Photography Skill&lt;/b&gt; if your pictures aren't turning out good.</Text>
  <Text Key="050F8D9F">Within the Cupid's Corner phone menu you'll see there are a few additional options.

There's also an option to visit &lt;b&gt;Cupid's Counseling&lt;/b&gt; with your partner if you need to work through any issues in your relationships. Then there is the option to &lt;b&gt;Deactivate Cupid's Corner&lt;/b&gt; if you're not interested in this app for your Sims.\n\nHowever you use Cupid's Corner it's here to make it easy for you to meet new Sims.</Text>

  <Text Key="8FB68235">A Sim's Romantic Satisfaction goes up from having positive romantic experiences. Succeeding at romantic socials is important, but don't forget about &lt;b&gt;Sim's Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs!&lt;/b&gt; Knowing the Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs of each Sim in a relationship is important: catering to Turn-Ons and avoiding Turn-Offs will build high satisfaction.
On the other hand, Sim couples who can't maintain mutual satisfaction will find it harder to keep up the relationship. Blundering into a Partner Sim's Turn-Offs will certainly drive their satisfaction down. (As will breaking Romantic Boundaries—"cheating" on a Partner.)</Text>
  <Text Key="D5310131">Sims may have very different or even opposing Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Each Sim will have their own needs in a relationship, reflected in their own satisfaction level. Ignore these needs at your Sims' romantic peril!
When Sims meet and introduce each other, you get to learn some of their Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. You'll find out more as they continue to interact and get to know each other.
Want to adjust your Sim's Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs? Head to Create a Sim, then &lt;b&gt;Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs&lt;/b&gt; next to &lt;b&gt;Likes and Dislikes.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text Key="558C441D">Sims will start thinking about Romantic Satisfaction with a Partner after they have "made it official" or built a high enough level of romantic relationship. Lovebug and Romantic Sims will start with a slightly higher level of Romantic Satisfaction, while Romantically Reserved and Noncommittal Sims will start with a slightly lower level.
