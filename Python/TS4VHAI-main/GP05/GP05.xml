  <Text Key="7624349E">Character Values determine a Sim's ability to adapt and behave effectively in everyday life. There are 5 Character Values that can be positive or negative: Manners, Responsibility, Conflict Resolution, Empathy, and Emotional Control. Toddlers, Children, and Teens can gain or lose values based on their actions and how their parents participate in these behaviors.\n\nOnce a Sim ages up to a Young Adult, their Character Values are locked in, and they will receive a unique Trait depending where their Character Values lie.</Text>
  <Text Key="E88EC459"> Children and Teens can see their Character Values progress in the Simology panel. Each of the 5 values can be viewed here.\n\nOnce a value has reached the dark ends of the meter, the Sim is in range to receive a Trait when they age up. The Sim can still fall out of range until they age up to a young adult.\n\nHover over each Character Value to view ways you can influence the value.</Text>
  <Text Key="5E064C5A">Depending on the traits the Sim starts with, they may have some Character Values to begin with. For example, a Sim with the Slob trait will start with a little bit of negative Manners. But Sims can still change their Manners values through their actions, such as cleaning up dishes. They won't be stuck in the negative as long as their actions speak louder than their heart!</Text>

  <Text Key="CE632F97">Children often need a firm parent to help shape them into model citizens. They need to be taught that making a mess isn't acceptable. Parents can encourage or discourage their positive and negative behavior.\n\nDiscouragement comes in a variety of severities. Parents could gently ask a child not to do something, give the child a firm talking to, or lose it and yell at the child to stop.</Text>
  <Text Key="EC6C359F">A child won't always react to discipline in the same way. It is important to pay attention to the reaction a child gives. Sometimes they will listen willingly, sometimes they will listen unwillingly, and sometimes they will outright reject the disciplinary action.</Text>
  <Text Key="DD56991C">Discipline will increase or decrease key character values. Those character values will also influence how children respond to discipline and grounding rules.</Text>
  <Text Key="2D11C2FE">When a child really misbehaves the only recourse can be Grounding. The parent chooses which of the child's favorite activities to Ground them from. All groundings last for one day. Responsible children wouldn't dare break a grounding rule. Less responsible children may try to get away with a lot more. A child caught breaking grounding rules can be grounded again.</Text>

  <Text Key="A530E89F">Sims can raise their Parenting Skill by researching on the computer or by reading skill books. The best way to improve is actual parenting. In fact, the only way to reach the top levels of Parenting Skill is by practicing parenting skills. Work with children to encourage good behavior and discourage poor behavior. A caregiver solving a child's needs using the parenting socials will learn from that experience.</Text>
  <Text Key="4A0B3EC5">Learning moments happen all the time for children. It is up to parents to decide what behavior to encourage or discourage. Is the child making a mess? Choose to have a calm discussion on appropriate behavior or take a more forceful approach and yell at them to stop.</Text>
  <Text Key="8D4FA4C4">All adults can now learn the Parenting Skill. This skill is vital for any Sim looking to raise happy and well behaved children.</Text>
  <Text Key="953D7D12">As a parent, a Sim will also feel the need to guide children through their daily routines. Parents can take a soft approach and try to influence their children to do things like clean dishes or go to bed. Some more stubborn children will need a more direct approach. Parents can give the child no option and force them to do their chores.</Text>
  <Text Key="C5BD11EB">A parent's job isn't just about directing a child's behavior. Skilled parents will also help their children out by quickly solving their needs. The caregiver can influence the child to get a quick snack to hold off hunger. Other times they can tell the child to dust themselves off to quickly clean up.</Text>
  <Text Key="DF3CA0F4">A challenge with Babies is that their communication skills are just sub-par. A great parent will pick up on non-verbal cues and can determine what the baby needs. Knowing when a baby is hungry vs. sleepy could save many needless hours of crying.</Text>
