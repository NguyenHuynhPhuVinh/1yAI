  <Text Key="6DB8A15F">This painting uses paint colors commonly used by Selvadoradian artists. Their palette is derived from the Omiscan relics excavated and cleaned up by archaeologists in the Belomisia jungle.</Text>
  <Text Key="844F5FCA">The use of sandpaper in this piece really provides some grit.</Text>
  <Text Key="B2E95214">The shapes and colors in this piece fit the established Omiscan formula for bathroom signage. I wonder if the artist knew this about the pieces that influenced his or her own art.</Text>
  <Text Key="FCB1E2D3">I can see the classic inspiration in this work. The inspiration from beavers, woodpeckers, and termites is front and center.</Text>
  <Text Key="151B55AE">Everything that is old is new again and this piece proves that. This style has been done before and will be done again.</Text>
  <Text Key="BBE1F653">Wood was one of the original crafting materials sculptors would use. Unfortunately not many pieces survive the centuries. The sculpting techniques have survived and are in display in this piece.</Text>
  <Text Key="116A23A2">The sculpt here is reminiscent of the decorative reliefs which appear in Omiscan temples.</Text>
  <Text Key="842E4EB0">If I squint my eyes I can just make out the Selvadoradian influences in this painting. This artist must've visited the Omiscan ruins while perfecting their eye for colors.</Text>

  <Text Key="E49DF402">Selvadorada is divided into two regions.\n\nThe Plaza district contains rentable lots, the Cantina, the Puerto Llamante Marketplace, and the Alam Museum of Archaeology. Here you can mingle with Selvadoradians in a safe village environment.\n\nThe Belomisia Jungle district is where adventurers go in search of Omisca Ruins and ancient artifacts. The natural dangers of the jungle are very real. Make sure to be bring supplies to combat these dangers.</Text>
  <Text Key="2C98FAA3">In the Puerto Llamante Marketplace you can find locals selling the best Adventure Gear to combat the Natural Dangers of the Belomisia Jungle.

  <Text Key="5A9AD23D">Sims can stick their heads in a skill book or they can head out into the field to learn Archaeology.\n\nIn the Belomisia Jungle, Excavate Dig Piles or Excavation Sites to increase skill. The archaeology work bench can be used to Uncover and Authenticate found artifacts. Sims with a high level skill may also receive requests from the Archeology Institute to authenticate artifacts. Sims need to remember to return those objects to collect a service fee.</Text>
  <Text Key="EEC6C634">Dig piles and Excavation Sites will have a number of different items to be found. Expect to find clumps of dirt, Unauthenticated artifacts, fossils, bone dust and more.\n\nClumps of Dirt may look unexciting, but with the help of a archaeology work bench a Sim can find the artifact within.\n\nIf you find bone dust make sure to keep it. Bone dust can be traded to Selvadoradians for powerful poison antidotes.</Text>
  <Text Key="73F8E137">One of the perks of the Archaeology Skill is the ability of upgrading dig piles to excavation sites.  Excavation sites allow up to four Sims to dig at once. These sites also allow archaeologists to dig up more artifacts than a standard dig pile.\n\nWith a Level 6 or higher archaeologist, click on a dig pile and choose 'Establish Excavation Site'.</Text>
  <Text Key="1C906EA0">Sims who love history and love digging in the dirt find a fortunate confluence of these passions in Archaeology. This skill will reward you with knowledge, and fabulous artifacts to decorate the house.</Text>
  <Text Key="8167A614">Every Archaeologist needs a dependable Archaeology Work Bench to work on. This handy work bench allows a Sim Uncover Artifacts from clumps of dirt. They then can Authenticate those artifacts to determine their rarity.\n\nWhen an artifact is fully authenticated the Sim can still Analyze the collectible for fun and archaeology skill!</Text>
  <Text Key="FBC04CD2">Archaeology </Text>
  <Text Key="54A78446">Sims may encounter Path Obstacles blocked with large stone doors. There is no way to get through these paths during the current vacation. These paths may be open during the next vacation to Selvadorada. Visit again for new paths to explore.</Text>
  <Text Key="77ECFB66">Path Obstacles will block progression into the jungle. When a Sim finds one of these large gates overgrown with vines they can use their hands to clear it. A better prepared adventurer will use any Jungle Machete they have in their inventory and avoid the sore hands. Sims with high gardening skill will have a easier time clearing these Path Obstacles.</Text>
  <Text Key="AEE1976E">Fire Flies, Spiders, Plasma Bats, Lighting Bugs, and Bees are all possible Natural Dangers sims will encounter in the jungle.\n\nA smart explorer will always have adventure gear in their inventory to ward off these troubles. The less prepared explorer will have to suffer all the burns, poisons and shocks that the Jungle throws at them.\n\nHigh Selvadoradian Culture, Fitness, and Logic skill will help Sims avoid some of these Natural Dangers.</Text>
  <Text Key="E3BB2379">There are hidden areas in the Belomisia Jungle. Reveal these areas by traveling through Path Obstacles. Sims will be rewarded for their curiosity. These areas contain dig piles, collectibles, and environmental buffs.</Text>

  <Text Key="A61E8C9C">Mystical Relics are powerful objects created by combining top and bottom pieces with a refined crystal. They can be used to cast powerful curses or blessings on Sims.</Text>
  <Text Key="13162096">Top and bottom pieces of these relics are found in Omiscan Temple treasure chests and excavation sites in the Belomisia Jungle.</Text>
  <Text Key="B226268E">Each Sim will have to learn through trial and error what a Mystical Relic will cast. Once a Sim has cast a mystical relic on themselves or another Sim they will learn the curse or blessing cast by that mystical relic combination. This information will be displayed in the mystical relic tooltips and in the tooltips on the pieces during the combination process.</Text>
  <Text Key="BBBB4A68">To create a Mystical Relic a Sim needs to have all the pieces in their inventory. A top and bottom relic piece and a refined crystal are needed. First, Click on a top or bottom Mystical Relic piece and choose 'Fuse With…'. Select an appropriate piece to combine. Once completed, Click on the combined Mystical Relic piece and choose "Insert Crystal". Select the refined crystal and complete the process.</Text>
  <Text Key="D71FB5B0">Each Mystical Relic is powered by a refined crystal. A Sim with Archaeology Skill can use a Archaeology Table to Refine a crystal. Crystals are either common, uncommon, or rare . These rarities influence which curse or blessing a Mystical Relic can cast.</Text>
  <Text Key="B466AFAA">All curses can be dispelled through hard work.  Check the information on the buff for clues on how to solve the curse.  A successful solve will result in a blessing being bestowed on the Sim.\n\nSims can also dispel curses by donating to the Statue of Madre Cosecha. This will not result in a blessing.</Text>
  <Text Key="C3ED6292">Each time a curse or blessing is cast there is a chance that a Mystical Relic can be damaged. Cracks will appear if this happens. If the Mystical Relic is damaged again it will be destroyed.\n\nKeep all mystical relic pieces you find so you can replace old Mystical Relics that have been destroyed from use.</Text>
  <Text Key="79F8686D">Mystical Relics need time to recharge after casting a curse or blessing. If a Sim has casted a curse recently they will have to wait a few hours for the Mystical Relic to recharge.\n\nWhen a Sim is affected by curse or a blessing on them they cannot receive another curse or blessing. </Text>

  <Text Key="CC12FFB4">Sims who trek deep enough into the Jungle may find the Omiscan Temple.\n\nThis ancient temple has unexplainable properties which will confuse and boggle the unprepared. The layout of this temple will change with each visit to Selvadorada. Walls will rearrange, traps will change, and treasure chests will shuffle. If the temple is getting the best of your Sim, try returning on another vacation.</Text>
  <Text Key="DC1676E3">In order to get through the Omiscan Temple, the Sim must first solve the Temple's defenses. The Sim must find and activate the correct triggers in order for the gate to unlock and reveal the next room. Sims can examine each trap which will reveal if a trigger is valid or not. However, the Sim's success at validating a trigger depends on their skill level and the Temple defense they are examining. Hover over the Examine interaction to see which skill is associated with the defense.</Text>
  <Text Key="6E11C493">The Omiscan Temple will always have a rare Treasure Chest at the end with an assortment of great rewards. Open these chests to find pieces of Mystical Relics or Omiscan Treasures.</Text>

  <Text Key="89F5CF73">Not everyone in Selvadorada is a local. Don't get confused by the other tourists. Seek out Sims wearing the local fashion or working the local shops.\n\nLocals will have unique socials. During emergencies Sims can trade Bone Dust for Poison Antidotes with locals.</Text>
  <Text Key="4A69B72D">A Sim with a high Selvadoradian Culture Skill can dance the Rumbasim. This is the hottest dance craze in Selvadorada.\n\nA high skilled Sim also has access to the secret menu with vendors in the Puerto Llamante Marketplace. Click on a vendor and choose 'Purchase Secret Items'. A high skill also allows Sims to ward off lightning bugs and firefly natural dangers without the need of adventure gear. But really, it's all about the Rumbasim.</Text>
  <Text Key="5711A18E">When in Selvadorada, do as the Selvadoradians do. Sims can gain the Selvadoradian Culture skill while interacting with the locals. A Sim with this skill will be able to learn local survival tips, appreciate the flavor of the local food, learn new guitar songs and even pick up a few dance moves.</Text>
  <Text Key="B82B7CD2">Raising this skill is as simple as interacting with the Selvadoradians, trying their foods, and shopping in the open air market. Locals have a lot of knowledge.  Try asking them about local sights, the Omiscan Ruins, or about the jungle. Soon you will be able to use the Selvadoradian greetings or retell the local folk tales.</Text>
