It's technically a houseplant, so shouldn't it be dead by now?! According to Goth family lore, this tree used to grace the parlor of a palm reader. One day, the tree bore a single coconut which dropped onto the noggin of the palm reader during a reading. Irritated that she didn't predict the unpleasant bop on the head, the palm reader gave the palm to her old friend: Lady Ravendancer Goth. The tree never produced any more coconuts, but still...watch out.</Text>

  <Text Key="3A5BFD96">Yeah she and I go way back, things are... complicated. But she's definitely bad news. \n\nHere, try placing one of these Idols on ground. She &lt;i&gt;hates&lt;/i&gt; these things, and conveniently enough they hate her too!\n\nIf that doesn't work, use your Medium skills to summon Bonehilda! She's actually a master in spirit-based mixed martial arts, and will gladly lend a hand.</Text>

Just try not to eat too many if possible...</Text>

Maybe find another way to appease Specters?</Text>
  <Text Key="AD9DE014">You did WHAT? First of all, how? Second, why? Actually I don't need to know all the details, lets just leave it at that.\n\nThankfully I may have just the solution. Try uhh, &lt;i&gt;absorbing&lt;/i&gt; one of these. This should replace whatever you stripped out, and maybe numb that stinging feeling of regret.\n\nJust maybe be more conscious of what you do with your soul next time?</Text>

  <Text Key="7606A5AB">Whoa! I can see that! You should make sure you're near a Sacred Candle to calm down!\n\nHere, take this Wraith Wax.
