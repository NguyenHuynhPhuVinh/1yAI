  <Text Key="EBB55930">Ravenwood Rumors</Text>
  <Text Key="92583CCB">This tree was long gnarled and elderly, even before I came to find myself tied here somehow. It has a pull to it; it truly does seem like a guarding force that protects and watches over me. Sometimes, Sims will come and offer gifts to it. I've always felt as if trees could communicate with one another somehow, and after all this time...in a way, I think I can communicate with the Guardian Tree myself. </Text>
  <Text Key="F09145B9">I used to understand what it meant when someone would ring the bell at that Bell Tower; surely it was used to summon the community and bring them all together to talk. But since I can't go to it, I can only imagine. When I hear it, I think of all the gatherings I've missed with my children over all these years. </Text>
  <Text Key="A860CF5F">Have you had a chance to find my little girl, Edith? You'll find the glowing well that she's made her home over in Crow's Crossing. I don't understand how it happened, but she has such a temper now. I promise you, she was a sweet-tempered, mild little girl before. I feel so sad that I can't travel to see her. If only I could be there to soothe her again.</Text>
  <Text Key="F3B2F496">Losing your loved one, even if they're still around as a Ghost Sim, can be hard no matter what. I admit that my approach has always been to just kind of act like things aren't so different after all. With a son in the equation, I guess my calculus was to just make it seem like it was a change but nothing dramatic. </Text>
  <Text Key="78DA7594">After Kai died, it was hard to fully adapt and explain everything to Takama. We were able to heal a bit just by putting effort into customizing Kai's gravesite. Takama had a big part in it and we were able to put our own special touch for things that represented Kai the best. We even got to choose which urn or gravestone to use!</Text>
  <Text Key="50989892">Kai being a Skeptical Sim probably seems absurd given, well, his circumstances. It's certainly interesting to be so sure that something doesn't exist when it's not only right in front of you, but it's literally who you are as well. We all have something we're stubborn about though, don't we?</Text>
  <Text Key="CD2F23DA">Last time I took Takama to the Ravenwood Family Day, we went for a long walk afterward and ended up stumbling across Edith near her well. Takama was transfixed by her, but I really just wanted to get him out of there; I was pretty scared myself. That head tilt... </Text>
  <Text Key="CBB60543">We moved to Whispering Glen when we wanted to have life at a slightly slower pace, and I absolutely love it here. The Final Draught is where I love to go to unwind after a long day—and I've even seen Sims hold wakes there. It's hard to miss the Ancestor cliff, though I make it a point to go out and observe it for a while anyway. I mean, you gotta go to the Moon Revelry festival sometimes, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="DFFB45BF">I'm not sure if it's jitters since Kai passed away or if it's something else, but I have this feeling like Grim's on my tail, too. The other day I was hit by lightning and then, I was electrocuted when I turned on the TV! I was thinking about going stargazing in Whispering Glen, but I don't think that's a great plan.</Text>
  <Text Key="2DB63D9F">The idea of Unfinished Business didn't really appeal or matter much to Kai before he died, you know. It's weird because he's so practical but also sure of what he wants that you'd think he'd have wanted to nail it down. Personally, that's not workable for me. I've wanted to make sure I get to do all the things I want to do in life while I have the chance.</Text>
  <Text Key="95C1CACB">After Kai died, Takama started wearing a crow outfit a lot. I remember Layne stopping by and asking what that was about and a lot of questions about how the family was handling grief. Grief definitely has a lot of permutations, doesn't it? But I think Takama wanted to feel connected to his father and that's that. </Text>
  <Text Key="C50FD7A9">The Ancestor is probably the most beautiful part of Whispering Glen in my opinion. Scholars and scientists here claim it was an effigy of a long dead ruler, though considering how long I've been dead, even I don't know who carved it. Some local "paranormal experts" say the tears that the visage cries during the full moon can link back to the Netherworld, some just say it's flood water run off. Did you know it's the place people perform old rituals during the full moon? Ah, &lt;i&gt;rituals&lt;/i&gt;. Just thinking about them warms my heart.</Text>
  <Text Key="FD1D2C58">I swear, the way the Reaper Career has spread around here makes you wonder if it's actually a career choice or something a little more, well, &lt;i&gt;consuming&lt;/i&gt;. I'll admit it, though, the whole reason I bought into it was because it meant I had a chance to look at those amazing scry bowls. Like, are those an amazing aesthetic or what?</Text>
  <Text Key="C9E5FA35">My sister and her husband used to be dead like me; Tziporah resurrected herself with Ambrosia, and I've heard Radwan was Reborn at the Baleful Bog right here in our Mourningvale! </Text>
  <Text Key="AE3796A3">It's awkward being distant from a sibling you don't even dislike, but Tziporah and I just haven't gotten along for a while. I'm not sure if you realize this, but she was a ghost too for a long, long time before she decided to take ambrosia. It almost felt like a betrayal, given how long we were together. To make things worse, she wants me to take ambrosia now, too. Why? What's wrong with my life the way it is now?</Text>
  <Text Key="C49EB861">Some Sims can be so cruel or uncaring. I've heard them tell stories about that poor, dear ghost by the Guardian Tree. Alice is her name, you know. She lost one of her children in an especially tragic way, but she's missing all of her children. But the way the stories spin it is all wrong! They talk about her like she's terrifying and unapproachable. I'm sure that if you just helped her by talking to her and seeing if there's anything that would help her be more at peace, they'd find a version of Alice that's rather changed from the "scary" ghost story Sims tell. </Text>
  <Text Key="A0C6A234">Waylon and I are "old" friends, and by old I mean we've both been dead a very, very, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; long time. We're close, but I know full well that he's a little excessive. Did you know he writes the script for the "Ravenwood Welcoming Committee" and anyone on it has to read it? The guy's just a wee bit, well, insufferable. </Text>
  <Text Key="8CBC22ED">Way back when I was still living, I wanted to know everything I could about the ghostly world. Now, of course, I'm literally a ghost so I suppose it seems as if I know all there is to know. I still really wanted to dabble in Ghost History, to feel like I'm truly the most knowledgeable ghostie I can be. Mainly because I can't stand the thought of Waylon lording that over me. Waylon! You're not in charge of &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; around here! Chill out!</Text>
  <Text Key="0ACC9869">Oh! Have you met Lady Ravendancer yet? She's such an idol, I love her. We go way, way, way back. Modern mortals don't know much about her other than that she is a renowned spellcaster and tarot card reader. She once had a legion of followers named &lt;i&gt;The Order of Lenore&lt;/i&gt; that has since dwindled over the years. She has ties to the Gomes family, did you know? Some of her followers still exist, I love watching them search for her tarot deck.</Text>
  <Text Key="90EB50F0">Ekade is pushing me to start trying to talk to other Sims about my "condition" after our crow attacked me. I've been going to Afterlife Anonymous to try and understand Ghost Sims, but I confess that I'm as confused as ever. They keep acting like I'm one of them!</Text>
  <Text Key="051EA481">I love birds, and our pet crow is practically like another child to me. I've spent years researching their history from Grim's aviary to the way their "crow collective" behaves. Unfortunately, I also pushed too hard when trying to understand what happens if you provoke them. It was a terrible mistake, and I regret it in more ways than one. </Text>
  <Text Key="7EA440C9">I confess, I don't like opening up a lot unless I know people well. You seem mostly harmless, but I like to make sure I know all the ins and outs of a situation or a person before I get too involved. Plus, around here you get a lot of ghost nonsense pushed on you if you talk to the wrong people. I don't believe in ghosts, really, and don't want them around even if they do exist. You saw my sign, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="8987E0C5">I bet you joke about it behind my back a bit, but of course I am working on settling with the reality of my situation after I was attacked by a crow. Sometimes a Sim can know the truth of a thing in their heart but it's just too shameful or difficult to show it outwardly. I'm working on it, but while some personality traits can feel really changeable, sometimes it's hard to make yourself want to change.</Text>
  <Text Key="F0343489">That Waylon Warez weirdo over by the crypts has annoyed me for years. I don't care what he's trying to foist on gullible buyers, I've got better things to do with my time. Do I seem like a guy who wants to be friends with many ghosts?</Text>
  <Text Key="9A91AABB">Some say people meet and be together in more than one lifetime. That feels a little overly optimistic to me, but I've heard that it does indeed exist. What I was told is that it would take a lot of work to convince your former loved one. It seems far-fetched, but as I said: I've heard about it from Sims I know!</Text>
  <Text Key="228C7973">I've been friendly with Layne for a long time. Did you know the first band he had was a cottagecore deal? You should have seen the outfits he had. "Galloping Goat Graces" was the first song he put out. </Text>
  <Text Key="CEEDD4F9">My mind must be playing tricks on me, given that these things couldn't possibly exist, but after my accident it's almost like I have new...abilities. They felt like some sort of evil manifestation; if such abilities were real, I wonder if they'd all be evil, or if some might be more benign. But how would you even get them? After all, ghosts don't exist!</Text>
  <Text Key="1DD36BC6">I hope you don't feel like you got the rug yanked out from under you. I wouldn't have talked to you about who I am if I didn't like you and trust you. I guess I'm just a bit weirder than expected, though, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="FCF66C37">I was out for a stroll and caught a ghost Sim using their abilities right out in the street. It tickles me a little to see them possess musical objects, which I've also seen when invited over to spend time with a ghost. It's hard not to envy powers like those. </Text>
  <Text Key="67CF6B0D">Do you ever hear an inner voice telling you to be mean? I mean, certainly that's something every Sim experiences, isn't it? But how often is the real question, isn't it? </Text>
  <Text Key="F9FDE271">I suppose you've been talking to other Sims about me, huh. I can sort of tell. People will whisper about me a lot when I'm out with Olive. If they're scandalized, too bad!</Text>
  <Text Key="4B8BF986">If you stop by the Baleful Bog, you can temporarily become a Ghost. I've got a pet Death Frog for a similar reason, though I confess: it makes me feel a little odd to merely pretend to be a ghost. My motto as a musician is that if you're gonna go for it, you should go all the way! </Text>
  <Text Key="CD019BE8">Can you believe that when Olive and I first met up—at the cemetery, naturally—she had no idea I'm a musician? It was refreshing to run into someone who doesn't know you before they know you.</Text>
  <Text Key="411392F6">I've always felt a strange pull towards death. It never felt right to admit, but what I was drawn towards wasn't just the, well, grim idea of death so much as the potency of seeing a spectrum of existence around it. There's an event, Celebration of Life, that happens in Crow's Crossing sometimes. I'll visit to get a taste of the other side of death; the moment when the living gather to bask in remembrances of you.</Text>
  <Text Key="0CC31025">Have you ever dabbled in Thanatology? I find it fascinating; I suppose it just lends an even more mysterious air to me, but I can't help but find it compelling. You've heard that you can eventually make Soul Soup, yes?</Text>
  <Text Key="B9FED1AA">I'm highly competitive, had I told you that before? The thought of a game where your very life hangs in the balance is maybe a little bit more thrilling than it should be for a guy like me. I'd heard that you could challenge Grim himself to a chess game. But, as I said, I'm competitive. I seem to have a real knack for winning, for good or ill. </Text>
  <Text Key="0EA115F6">I've noticed those little green fellas over by the swing sets in Crow's Crossing, and I've also noticed that a couple houses elsewhere here seem to have a lot going on. I'm dying, practically &lt;i&gt;dying&lt;/i&gt;, to spend time in haunted places.</Text>
  <Text Key="1DB65009">Radwan and I used to date way back when, you know. He's a sweet guy, but in the end we just weren't totally compatible. I think he wanted to settle down into a quiet family life. Funny how things turn out; his settled down family life involves that absolute whirlwind of a woman, Tziporah. They make a great couple, though. </Text>
  <Text Key="A10FC735">My future stepfather is such a weirdo. Explain this: one day, the Sim's out by the crypt in Crow's Crossing looking at the gravesite for one of my mom's dead husbands. What is that all about? I saw him pat the headstone and smile affectionately. Creep alert! </Text>
  <Text Key="3C2829C1">Hey, did you know you can catch these really cool Death Frogs around Ravenwood? I have the best luck in the cemetery. I love frogs, y'know. My mom jokes about how I'm a big collector of things. You can catch me around sometimes at festivals, even. Hit me up at Ravenwood Family Day and we'll talk frog.</Text>
  <Text Key="70953AA6">It probably seems weird but since there's been a lot of, uh, death in my family over time, even before I was around, I end up feeling pretty close to death. I mean, mom's career kinda adds to that. But what I mean is, I'm in those crypts a lot just wandering around and thinking. I'd say it's a great place to get away from my soon-to-be-stepdad, but I can't tell you how often I see him leaving the crypts right when I'm stopping by. </Text>
  <Text Key="0948AF48">I've honestly been really lonely since my best friend Pascal moved. I mean the guy basically disappeared off the map! Deleted his Social Bunny and everything. It's how I ended up talking to Edith so much. I kept going for walks all by myself and trying to talk to her. Not like I had anyone else, you know?</Text>
  <Text Key="02C7F7E1">Everybody seems to have theories about who my real dad is, like it's their business. The funny thing is, sometimes when I'm walking around, I'll see a weird reflection of a black cloak behind me. I feel a really strange tie to the idea of death and reaping. Wait, not creepy like that, I mean...well, just the idea of Grim is something, huh? </Text>
  <Text Key="643EA3D0">Zelmira got way into that tarot stuff a while back and got me all interested in the Order of Lenore stuff. You know about that, right? It was appealing to me, cuz I feel like I'm just always in some random danger that I can't predict or understand. Tarot gives me a sense of order, I think? Or it makes things feel less chaotic. Whatever, I just like it a lot. You've gotten cards and seen the tomes around Ravenwood and all that, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="3DD3CDC4">The other day, the TV was on the fritz and it electrocuted me. Out of nowhere, there's Layne just standing there saying, "Watch yourself, kid, you'll die of electrocution if you're not careful" in this dreamy voice. I wonder if all his little fans know that the eccentric musician act is absolutely not an act.</Text>
  <Text Key="1FFA4DC0">You found out the truth about Layne, right? That guy's supposed to be my new dad. Yeah right! Like I want touching father/son moments with a freak-o-rama who &lt;i&gt;wants&lt;/i&gt; my mom to turn him into a ghost. Uh, let's not unpack anything you think you know about my mom, okay? We're not touching that. </Text>
  <Text Key="49C88658">I've been a Mortician for years! My poor—and quite dearly missed—husbands met some...unfortunate ends and I really felt a calling to the craft. You know, we're always looking for new recruits!</Text>
  <Text Key="1F6A7E2F">My philosophy when it comes to décor is that if you're not making sure your place has personality, you're not &lt;i&gt;living&lt;/i&gt;. Or a ghost either. Not my point. But anyway, I'm sure some places have more personality than most. My house has a serious issue with flickering lights, doors slammed by someone other than Nyon, and a TV that changes to static. It's odd, almost as if I'm haunted. Though why on earth should I be? My former husbands, all absolute dears, are resting quite peacefully!</Text>
  <Text Key="7876543D">I feel so bad about Zuleika dying like that, from her own plant no less! It's not like I lost her completely, but it's not the same to hang out with a ghost. Still, we try to talk whenever she stops back by Crow's Crossing. She doesn't ask a lot of questions about my past, which is very refreshing given, well, &lt;i&gt;you know&lt;/i&gt;. </Text>
  <Text Key="1B076D10">Just before we moved to Crow's Crossing, we were warned that it's a little on the lively side. I have to say, we were not warned that a memorial cannon is occasionally fired. That might have been appreciated! I've chosen to stay away from that well not too far from us too; I've heard what sounded like a child shrieking or having some sort of tantrum last time I came close and I just thought, "You know what? I don't need a shrieking child in my life, thank you &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; much."</Text>
  <Text Key="9476AD11">More than once, I've walked into a room to see Layne just staring at the TV. He's been transfixed by the Static TV channel. Wouldn't you think he has better things to do? He seems mesmerized by it. </Text>
  <Text Key="FD6D06B6">Nyon's been more distant with me these days. I guess that's just what happens with a lot of teenagers, but he's also been asking a lot of questions about his dad and about my past as well. Personally, I'd rather leave the past dead and buried. Wouldn't you? </Text>
  <Text Key="9F434DE5">Because the cemetery isn't far from me, I visit often. I feel like I'm quite acquainted with the dead, and it's calming to see the gravesites tended to. I'll often just peer into the pond. Layne, though, he's gone straight for that pond when he's visited. He caught a frog out of it one night; peculiar little thing.</Text>
  <Text Key="3395AC29">Have you seen that strange Bell Tower in Mourningvale? I'd heard once that people used to gather whenever someone rang its bell. I wonder if that's true? It makes me feel so odd whenever I walk past it. </Text>
  <Text Key="EAAD2033">Tziporah and I got married after she took ambrosia. She just really wasn't into being a ghost. I can't blame her—I sure don't want her to be one, either. I just wish she was a little bit less of a klutz. I feel like Grim's always just around the corner from our place.</Text>
  <Text Key="96E5A780">Oh! You've heard the story about Moppy, that goat statue in Crow's Crossing, right? It's this whole local legend thing. Apparently some medieval nomads were off in search of sustenance when they ran into an odd woman who claimed she could read Tarot cards. Ravendancer, I think. The wandering souls were so enthralled by her that they felt as if they'd been enchanted. When they came across a goat, they thought it must be magical in some way and chased it instead of catching it to eat it. The goat led them to a bountiful land—this one! Over the years, the legend of Moppy—the goat who led them to good fortune—has been told over and over again.</Text>
  <Text Key="685CEE22">You know Zelmira's gotten really into tarot, right? They've even started giving readings to other Sims at the Thinned Festiveil. They're an unusual Sim; really passionate about some of the darker or more Macabre aspects of life, but always fun to be around.</Text>
  <Text Key="00A31974">I've had this strange sense about myself my whole life, as if I've walked similar steps before but in a completely different existence. Like some of these experiences are ones I've had before, yes? You've heard of Deja Vu, of course. There have always been rumors about the Baleful Bog being a place of renewal, of rebirth. Imagine living another life, though. I already feel like I've lived two lives just in this body!</Text>
  <Text Key="ABFD9BE8">No one likes talking about end-of-life things, I get it. Though I like to think if we're honest about what matters to us, it helps our family more later on. That's why I always remind people that it's better to head over to the Town Hall sooner rather than later to meet up with an attorney to get your Will all sorted. It's easier than you think. </Text>
  <Text Key="0FA7D76A">Each Sim has their own unique perspective on life and the life thereafter. Sometimes we want to be with those who reflect our beliefs back, but sometimes we also thrive in our differences while embracing our similarities. Tziporah's beliefs are somewhat different than my own, but we share so many other common values. I feel like she's a Sim I've known past my own life, if you understand what I mean.</Text>
  <Text Key="5944D44B">Would you believe there are people around that still associate me with the founding of this lovely little area? Picture it: Ages ago, right here in Ravenwood, well before anything was here of course, I'm just traipsing along minding my own business when &lt;i&gt;suddenly&lt;/i&gt; I turn around, and these filthy, hungry Sims were following me! I, of course, took pity and gave them a Tarot Reading. Eventually they got distracted by some stray goat and left me alone.</Text>
  <Text Key="B8912205">Once a week—on Wednesdays, I believe—the living and the dead gather together to celebrate the link between their worlds at the Thinned Festiveil. Of course, one must bring a gift for the tree if they attend! My relative, Zelmira, has given tarot readings there before. They certainly have a flair for it!</Text>
  <Text Key="F8D6222E">The interesting thing about being a ghost is that a lot of time can pass in a blink. Back when this area was named after Ravens, it made sense; my family was on the ascendance and there were ravens, not crows. Now, time has passed and I see that the crows from Grim's aviary have taken over. Perhaps a century from now, it will be back in the hands (or talons) of ravens!</Text>
  <Text Key="E9AA20E4">Zelmira Gomes was able to summon me once they'd collected all of my special Tarot cards. What an interesting individual; of course, our family tree has intertwined roots going all the way back to Lolita Goth, so it makes sense that there some commonalities between us. </Text>
  <Text Key="79B7C082">I have an absolutely scandalous secret to tell you! I'm sure you've heard of the Moon Revelry festival before, yes? It's in Whispering Glen, right near that rock they call the Ancestor. Well, apparently some Sims think it's best enjoyed au naturale on the Full Moon. Can you imagine? Personally, I'm only there to stargaze. I'd never dream of moonbathing without clothing!</Text>
  <Text Key="38566D11">Radwan is so protective of me at times. Honestly, even a little overprotective. He's behaving as if I'm just around the corner from dying again, and I know he doesn't want to lose me. It's sweet, but a little frustrating. Then again, I do seem to have absolutely rotten luck. I didn't know that provoking crows is a bad idea, so I did that recently and it almost killed me right off the bat. What kind of luck is that?</Text>
  <Text Key="1F06918B">All the friction I have with Esther is so frustrating for me. I just want xer to understand why it's so important for xer to live again. Xie thinks being dead is fine, and that the abilities xie has make it even better, but I can't accept it. Because I can write, I decided that I would work towards being able to write a Book of Life. When I have one, I'll be able to convince xer to come back. I know it. Esther will understand someday.</Text>
  <Text Key="39A56957">Whispering Glen is so peaceful. There's a little telescope that looks out over the countryside that I'll walk to on clear nights to go stargazing. Radwan warns me off it, because he's paranoid I'll be hit by a meteor. But who wouldn't want to take in a view like that? Sometimes I'll just walk around by the stone ruins thinking about what I want to write about next. </Text>
  <Text Key="5129BF3D">Our family history has been convoluted over the years, to put it mildly. At least my grandfather had the good sense to start deciding which items should be considered Heirlooms for the family so they could be divvied up properly. My father? Not so much, and when my sister and I passed away it was a mess. Now that I have my second chance at life and all of that, I'm leaving a better example for Zelmira. I want them to feel a connection to all the things that matter to me enough to consider a part of our family story.</Text>
  <Text Key="0A599CA8">I'm not a direct descendent of the Goth family, but we do have a common ancestor from way back when. The Gomes family has had a long line since then. Radwan took my name to embrace that, since he was just starting on a different phase in his life and wanted to change his name altogether. </Text>
  <Text Key="DB8B81D8">Did you know that I spearhead the Ravenwood Welcoming Committee? That's right, sometimes I sacrifice a day's worth of vital sales just to show up with Pan de Muerto and regale you with wonderful information about the community. I usually rope a few other folks into coming with me. Everyone complains about the script I wrote, but I'm a guy who feels that anything worth doing is worth doing my way. </Text>
  <Text Key="91D14A5E">One thing you can never, ever be without: a casket! Used, new—does it matter? Okay, it might matter. Not the point. You need a casket, and you need one now—so you'd better check out the Try Before You Die Casket Sale to get all set up.</Text>
  <Text Key="7C9FAE3F">I've seen it all over the years when it comes to death. Rabid rodents, cowplants, poison, crows—death, death, death, death, death! And so many are so, well, dramatic and unexpected. I suppose it's a blessing that I just chose to go out peacefully on my own while I was in bed. Though I'll tell you, there were times I was worried that the mold in my old flat would take me out!</Text>
  <Text Key="DD24C3F3">When I was alive, I had so many friends. More than I do now, even. Of course, my charm has only grown over the years, but I was perfectly charming centuries ago, too. So I ask you: what sort of friends don't throw their friend one simple funeral upon death? That's right. I received no funeral. Nada! It hurts a little. You grind day after day, offering the best warez that Ravenwood has to offer, and what reward awaits you? Well, maybe someday someone will throw me a funeral. A Sim can dream.</Text>
  <Text Key="5658A69D">Lady Ravendancer Goth and I go way back. Way back. Way, way back. We're super close. Sure, she rolls her eyes at me constantly, but that's because it's hard for another Sim to stand across from me without recognizing that my charisma is quite simply unmatched.</Text>
  <Text Key="F049917A">I like to think of myself as the undesignated, unasked-for guardian of the Crypt here, so trust me; I know what everyone gets up to when they're in there. That's right, that's right; when you WooHoo in there, you're shaming yourself! Oh, c'mon. I'm &lt;i&gt;kidding&lt;/i&gt;. What, you think I've never had an amorous thought in my life?</Text>
  <Text Key="DB3A817D">Tarot cards are a lucky find and for sure take some exploring to collect. I hear that collecting the last card requires a brush with Death! Come find me at the Thinned Festiveil for a free reading anytime. I love having a chance to show off my Tarot deck and my tarot-reading prowess.</Text>
  <Text Key="389439C2">I think the biggest indicator that I'm Macabre is that I love, love, love rainy days but can't really stand being in the sun that much. It's not that I hate the outdoors, not at all! I just try to pay attention to the weird little things out there, and rainy days are just, well, a bit weirder to me.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F194C65">I've been talking to Nyon more lately, but his soon-to-be-stepdad is a real enigma. I mean, everyone knows the rumors about Olive. You've seen the headstones, right? You know, from her other husbands? Come on, does Layne look like he's someone who misses a beat? Ew, no pun intended. </Text>
  <Text Key="267B1808">I try not to think a ton about how my parents even work, really. I mean, my mom was basically a ghost for a super, super long time. My dad's always talking about how he must have lived past lives or something, given how he's always got this Deja Vu thing going. You know how people talk about "old souls"? I think my parents are like that, though they're totally different personality-wise. </Text>
  <Text Key="236B252C">I suppose my whole morbid-fascination-with-Ghosts thing kicked off after finding out about tarot and about my distant ancestor, but I've always found ghosts really compelling. I want to know everything I possibly can. Did you know my relative, Esther, is the same way—and xie is a ghost already. I guess you can never know too much about those who have passed on, can you?</Text>
  <Text Key="20E74D83">Name-dropping is so passé, I know, but I can't help myself. Imagine getting super, super into something only to find out that the Sim who does it best is literally related to you! Right, so, once I got into Tarot and found out that collecting a whole deck summons this Lady Ravendancer Goth, I was all in. Then I find out about some Sim named Lolita Goth, and I guess we're related somehow on mom's side of the family and all that. Can't even wrap my mind around it, right? I've heard so much totally weird gossip about our families from summoning her and talking to her.</Text>
  <Text Key="9CBF771C">A while back, I was walking around Crow's Crossing when I stumbled upon this strange book on a pedestal. I took a closer look and found my first &lt;b&gt;Tarot Card&lt;/b&gt;! I've been working at understanding my tarot cards and have even started giving readings at the Thinned Festiveil. I have a bit of a family relation to a kinda famous local ghost who's connected to those tomes and the cards themselves. Seriously!</Text>
  <Text Key="067C1932">Not too long ago, I'm out with my mom and we run into Layne. He and mom get to talking, and she mentions this whole thing she's got about writing a Book of Life to get her sibling back. Layne gave her this weird grimace and just said, "Why would you spend your time on &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;?". Way out of character for him. He's usually supportive of uh, other creative people I guess, but he seemed so put off by my mom even mentioning a Book of Life.</Text>
  <Text Key="E4A58DFE">You know I'm Olive's friend, right? She's such a fun, free spirit. I'm not surprised that Coffin guy is so into her, they're both really magnetic and neat together. Still, people stare at them a lot when they're out. Like, a lot a lot. What's that, you think?</Text>
  <Text Key="96B5627B">I was totally not planning to die, especially not while tending to a beloved cowplant. But death's unexpected, and I confess that I like the unexpected and unusual. That's how I ended up being so drawn to the Reaper career. The way Sims were talking about it, it was like some once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be a part of something bigger than yourself. I wish I'd heard about it while I was still alive. But now Esther and I are both into reaping together. You should see the amazing outfits that go with it.</Text>
  <Text Key="1FD1C3B5">You've seen that absolutely gorgeous, perfect undead cowplant in Mourningvale, right? Sometimes, Sims will come by to play violin for her for some reason. I love it, though; the music is almost as enchanting as the cowplant herself. You'd think I'd be angry, since one killed me...but I could never be angry at a plant for doing what it must to survive. We all have to, yes?</Text>
  <Text Key="5449C5B2">My funeral was wonderful; Olive set it up for me, and Layne was the musician. But you'll never guess who stopped by to play the piano: Grim himself! Can you believe it? I swear, he seems to just pop up more than you'd expect around Olive's family. </Text>
  <Text Key="2C989E3D">Waylon keeps telling me to go and spend more time with Alice over by her Guardian Tree. I wish I wasn't so busy; sometimes it's hard to find time to talk to her, even when I am over in the area. I've heard that a few Sims have asked her how they could help her feel more at ease. I just sort of assume she'll be anchored to that creepy old tree forever, always sad no matter what you do. I like to think I might be wrong, though. You should tell me if I am!</Text>
  <Text Key="42D19AED">I'm only starting to understand how to use my Ghost Powers since I haven't been a ghost all that long. The other day, Layne came by and was asking all these questions about how they work and what the differences are between the types of ghost powers and all that. I swear, the guy said something weird like "I can't wait" under his breath when I was telling him about Kai Aether's powers. I mean, we all die someday so I get it, but that was a little funky. </Text>
  <Text Key="AE7A54D9">Death isn't &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; the end, you know? There's no unspoken rule of life that says ghosts can't work toward their dreams! I deserve that feeling of pride and accomplishment just as much as any living Sim, especially since my Soul's Journey is still in progress. My Unfinished Business isn't going to finish itself!</Text>

  <Text Key="01AC9A71">Yeah, so, I noticed the grave for Hugh Thanasia a while before I even started seeing Olive. Did you know: more than anything, I want to be a Ghost, too! So the thought of Olive "helping" me is, well, kismet, right?\n\nCuz you see, while I didn't really lie to you about who I am... I also didn't quite tell you the truth. I was hiding the fact that I'm an Evil Sim, but now you know. It doesn't mean we're not still close friends; if anything, I feel closer to you than ever! I hope I'm not &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; Evil for ya, though.</Text>

  <Text Key="6E7F13EE">Today is a &lt;b&gt;Third Quarter Moon&lt;/b&gt;, so here's what I can share with you, Kiddo:\n\nRavenwood... I know what you're thinking, "Oh, they did it again! Ominous THEY! There are no Ravens here!" But wait, did you know, the name actually comes from the Legendary Tarot Reader, Lady Ravendancer? What a charmer! She once tried to give directions to a group of Nomads, but they were so beguiled by her, they took a wrong turn and got lost. Good thing Moppy came by to set them straight. As you kids would say it... Moppy Smacks!... Or is it "Slaps"? Nah. That's not it... Or is it? </Text>
  <Text Key="16F7F22B">Today is a &lt;b&gt;First Quarter Moon&lt;/b&gt;, so here's what I can share with you, Kiddo:\n\nAlice's Kids in a nutshell: 4 children were born from her in this order, Deimos the Sentenced, Ann the Beloved, Freddy the Jester, and Edith the Troublemaker.\n\nEveryone assumes Edith is pure evil, but she's just misunderstood...and also a little bit evil! But because she was always close to Freddy, she can occasionally be a silly moose! If you catch her in a playful mood, try mocking her; I'm sure she'll respond well to that!</Text>
  <Text Key="2C18695B">Today is a &lt;b&gt;Waxing Gibbous Moon&lt;/b&gt;, so here's what I can share with you, Kiddo:\n\nAs per my signed agreement with her, I am not allowed to say much about Moppy. Who is Moppy you say? &lt;i&gt;Who is Moppy?!&lt;/i&gt;\nI'm sure you have seen that fantastic Goat Statue at the center of Crow's Crossing. Well, that is Moppy, and all I can say about her is that she is the B.O.A.T.! (If you're not hip to the latest lingo, that stands for Bestest of All Time.)</Text>
  <Text Key="07566804">Today is a &lt;b&gt;Waning Gibbous Moon&lt;/b&gt;, so here's what I can share with you, Kiddo:\n\nSpecters... And I don't mean Olive and company with all of her &lt;i&gt;drama&lt;/i&gt;. I mean the little floaty fellas you see at Crow's Crossing or when you ring the Mourningvale Bell Tower bells. Believe it or not, they were once living Sims, but their sense of self has been long lost to them, either willingly or forgotten. The whole thing is, as youths would put it, a &lt;i&gt;brain rotten&lt;/i&gt; situation if you ask me. Still, I understand why Sims around these parts think Specters have &lt;i&gt;The Rizz&lt;/i&gt;. They radiate pure positivity, and that's a-okay in my book.</Text>
  <Text Key="14C663FB">Today is a &lt;b&gt;Full Moon&lt;/b&gt;, so here's what I can share with you, Kiddo:\n\nYou probably want to know more about The Ancestor. Y'know, the giant face carved into the side of that cliff in Whispering Glen. The Scrappity Restroom...or Scribbly Toilet...or whatever you kids call complete monstrosities these days. I'm so old my limbs creak and groan, and even &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; have no idea who that's supposed to be. It's been here as long as anyone can remember! The local Sims all gather to dance or something at the &lt;b&gt;Moon Revelry&lt;/b&gt;. Hooligans. All I can really say is, I would rather whoever carved it had left that dang cliff alone; the landscape would have been better with a more natural beauty—like me!</Text>
  <Text Key="67954E4F">Today is a &lt;b&gt;Waning Crescent Moon&lt;/b&gt;, so here's what I can share with you, Kiddo:\n\nI am called the Guardian Tree due to my protective... Wait for it... Nature! I kid, I kid, but I always watch out for those in need, that's why I take care of Alice here! Sims can stop by to rest and refresh themselves, as well as listen to my tales of wisdom. I've been around for an eternity, literally, and through my roots, I absorb the mystical waters of the Baleful Bog and the goings on of the world.\n\nWhatever gossip or speculation you come across, remember I was there to witness it! It's true! &lt;i&gt;No caps!&lt;/i&gt; Also, why the heck do youths get the cringe when I use their dialect? I'm cool. I dab. I can t-pose...or &lt;i&gt;tree pose&lt;/i&gt;, I should say. Ha! But not everyone is ready for the truth. A kid &lt;i&gt;ghostied&lt;/i&gt; me the other day for talking about the conspiracy theory I've got about the true nature of our reality—that we're not really in control of our own actions. I'm afraid I've already said too much...</Text>
  <Text Key="098339C2">Today is a &lt;b&gt;Waxing Crescent Moon&lt;/b&gt;, so here's what I can share with you, Kiddo:\n\nAh yes, the Baleful Bog! Did you know that the water there flows directly from the Netherworld itself? Yeah! It's what makes Mourningvale the Ghostly capital of the world. Botanists also speculate this is what makes the Undead Cowplants exist at all!\n\nYoung ones these days see a glowing puddle of supernatural waters with the power to alter their corporeal reality and say, "Cannon bomb!" oblivious to the dangers of having one too many &lt;b&gt;Out of Body Experiences&lt;/b&gt;. I've tried to warn them about the possibility of impending &lt;i&gt;actual death&lt;/i&gt; here, but all I get is an "Okay Doomer" response. Ah to be young and reckless.\n\nGhosts can find some interesting things here, too.

The &lt;b&gt;Simple Life, Simple Death Podium&lt;/b&gt; houses many Funeral interactions that a Sim might like to complete during the event.\n\nThe &lt;b&gt;Burial Casket&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Gravesite&lt;/b&gt; objects can store Sim remains, so feel free to drag a Deceased Sim's Urn from a Sim's Inventory to the floor or ground, and then into either of these objects. These objects also allow for Funeral interactions to be performed by selecting the Urn or Gravestone inside. To view the Urn inside the Burial Casket, select &lt;b&gt;Open&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nPlace a &lt;b&gt;Memorial Display&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Memorial Portrait&lt;/b&gt; and dedicate it to the deceased. If you would like a more celebratory event, place the &lt;b&gt;Memorial Cannon&lt;/b&gt; to give the Sim the most epic send off!\n\nAlthough Guest Sims will grieve freely during a Funeral, interactions like &lt;b&gt;Call Over Guests&lt;/b&gt; can help bring attention to certain activities that you would like to complete. &lt;b&gt;Funeral Activities and Interactions&lt;/b&gt; can be found by selecting &lt;b&gt;Sims&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;Funeral Podium&lt;/b&gt;, and the &lt;b&gt;Urn or Gravestone&lt;/b&gt; while a Funeral is in session.</Text>

The way the moonlight slips through the trees in this place casts a chill on my bones, one that all the lit hearths and warm mugs of spiced nectar in the world couldn't soothe. Decided to try my hand at the latter and headed to the local tavern. Locals call it "The Last Draught" or whatever. Funny folk around here. I sat at the wooden bar, ordered a Dim and Gusty, per the lady bartender's recommendation.\n"Stops the shivers," she said with a knowing smile as she handed it over. I drank it all. Didn't do much for me.\n"Anything to do around here?" I asked her.\n"Stay alive, until you don't," she said. "Getting too curious around here can shorten your life expectancy if you're not careful. Plenty of forlorn ghosts'll sing that tune, if you listen."\nI asked her about some tree I heard whispers about in town, the Guardian Tree. She looked at me like I'd said my mama was a cowplant. Then she leaned closer, all shifty-eyed.\n"Don't go there, if you know what's good for you," she whispered. "It's haunted. Don't know if that poor lady will ever find her, anyway..."\n\nI didn't dare to ask what she meant by that. I just stood up and left this cursed place for good.</Text>

A cold wind had blown it open, a terrifying omen for something otherworldly approaching. As she sat up, she didn't even need to light a candle to see the shadowed figure that appeared, his ominous form visible despite blending in so well with the night. He was wearing a black hooded cloak and holding a square-shaped, illuminated object in his withered hand. She couldn't identify the alien object he held...perhaps it most resembled a thin book emitting inexplicable light.\nHer tired eyes widened as she noticed images projected in the glow, flashing by as he swiped the lit surface. The figure made a sound that almost sounded like a &lt;i&gt;laugh&lt;/i&gt; as he noticed how spellbound she was by the imagery.

What if you didn't even have to &lt;i&gt;open&lt;/i&gt; it to see inside? You could make all your decisions from the outside looking in. Which artisan cold brew shall I sip today? How many courses did my private chef prepare for dinner tonight? These mundane things that Sims of the world would spend several valuable minutes a day contemplating with the fridge door open, they can all be done with this door closed.\n\nOf course, with this design update, it's no longer unbreakable. But what's life without a little risk?\n\nYou're welcome,\nVincent Schmapple</Text>

  <Text Key="5D7C3603">One day, when his friend Onyx was cooped up once again working his art, spellcaster Noah Fort had an idea. What if one could simply conjure art with magic? It could be efficient, requiring no skill, and inspired by existing paintings. Noah got to work, producing hundreds of spell-generated paintings in a day, bottling his spells to sell. They &lt;i&gt;seemed&lt;/i&gt; to be works of great value. But upon closer inspection, they looked &lt;i&gt;off&lt;/i&gt;, lacking any substance or vision.\nBut neither Noah, nor his customers, knew enough about art to tell. Soon, Noah's business took off. Homes filled with spell-generated paintings. "Artists" everywhere were posting them on Social Bunny, or even selling them for commissions under false pretenses. Noah's business failed, however, when Sims got better at identifying these falsified works and saw them as uncool.\nMeanwhile, Onyx finished his year-long project, a hauntingly beautiful set of paintings inspired by his hometown, Ravenwood. Years later, Onyx's paintings are heralded as some of the finest work of the recent century. Yet no one could remember Noah's work, or that of his customers. No amount of magic or efficiency can replace the value of a Sim with passion.</Text>

  <Text Key="A237EBA3">&lt;i&gt;An excerpt from an essay titled "The Folly of Grimperfection" by Edward Talon-Crow:&lt;/i&gt;\n\nGrim is often lauded as the sole arbiter of everything dark in this world. I take great issue with this idolatry. First, our mortality is perhaps the most macabre thing about us! We live and we die, driven by forces beyond our comprehension. Succumbing to the end of our mortal life, and becoming a feared ghost? That is the most macabre statement a Sim could make! Grim is neither alive nor dead. Grim simply exists. What's so macabre about being a static being?\nSecondly, wearing a black robe and proclaiming to be the ultimate shepherd of Sim souls is really just hubris at its finest. I have seen Grim's hirelings doing his duties in his stead. For those who don't care, I would urge you to imagine dying, and while observing your reaping, it's not Grim who carries it out, but some hired grunt. Grim is nothing but an industrious narcissist who has taken us all for a ride!\nNever forget, my fellow members of Simkind, we hold the most profound potential for embodying and celebrating darkness. Not some hooded figure with an unmatched ego!</Text>

  <Text Key="AA2F32EF">Lady Ravendancer Goth's grandmother always had an otherworldly talent with a sewing needle. It seemed as if every one of her creations was imbued heavily with magic. Most of the time she didn't even intend to sew magically heated quilts or sequined dresses that seemed to glow from within. It was just an unintended byproduct of her impressive power as a spellcaster. Lady Ravendancer often felt a similar latent power emanating from her hand-drawn tarot cards, as if her spellcasting power couldn't help but seep into the colors she wove, bringing each card alive. Unfortunately, that tendency wasn't the only thing that ran in her family. After some time, as her power grew along with her collection of tarot cards, she started to relate heavily with her grandmother's sharp awareness of her impending doom...as if someone, or &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;, out there felt she had grown just a bit too powerful.</Text>

Then, the following Monday, a puddle of some sort of glowing goo appeared. The day after? A jar of pickled Striped Eggplant Frog legs was left on it, one year past their expiration date. The next day, a popular bestselling novel in pristine condition appeared, but each word was slightly misspelled in uncanny ways. What other sorts of oddities might it accrue? Only time will tell...</Text>

It's a very...quaint company. Lots of potential! Just like Schmapple once was, a very very long time ago. We've grown a thousandfold since then, for the record.\n\nBut what matters is, while they handled the other rooms, we maintained creative control over the kitchen. And, of course, this is our first time delving into the "sink" space. We just wanted to bring our revolutionary product vision to the &lt;i&gt;Sink User Experience&lt;/i&gt;, and I'd say we achieved just that.\n\nEvery day for a year, I asked myself: "Vince, what if turning on a sink was as easy as lifting the handle, and getting the water to come out?" You might think me a madman for expecting it to be &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; easy. But I achieved that legendary vision with ease. For you, my friends. Sinks, to the power of you.\n\nStay hydrated,\nVincent Schmapple</Text>

  <Text Key="36966783">The dying candle flickered on Edward Talon-Crow's desk. He scrawled furiously with his feather quill by the candle's dull amber glow, seated on his favorite chair. Though he often referred to his favorite chair as "The Seat of Inspiration" today it seemed more like a castle spire, a viewpoint of defensive advantage and offensive pressure.\nTo call his fellow writers "peers" would be a stretch. They were talentless hacks, catering their inane drivel to the whims of the masses. That day, his most bitter rival, Fulov Pepp, had the &lt;i&gt;gall&lt;/i&gt; to publish a criticism of Edward's macabre themes. Rich, coming from a man whose most recent short story was about a cute puppy learning to walk. No grit, no grime, no realism. Just another gauche attempt at pulling the heartstrings of his gullible readers. The rebuttals wrote themselves, it seemed. His quill raced across the parchment, his counterattack mounting with each impassioned word.\nPernilla's last words before leaving him rang achingly in his mind as he wrote.\n&lt;i&gt;"One day, Eddie, you'll amount to something. It's a shame I won't be around to see it."&lt;/i&gt;\nOne day. One day he'd prove himself, as a writer, as a Sim!</Text>

  <Text Key="C74185C8">The llamagriff is a mythological creature dating all the way back to Myshupotamian times. A cross between a llama and an eagle, the regal llamagriff was often a symbol of pride or an otherworldly blessing, ever-present on the insignia of Myshupotamian royals. For centuries, most Myshupotamians believed llamagriffs could be found atop Mt. Komorebi.\nOver time, Myshupotamia sought to grow its relationship with the people of Mt. Komorebi, in the hopes of establishing long-distance trade routes. It was then that the myth was quickly debunked. Legend has it that when the current king of Myshupotamia visited Mt. Komorebi to meet with local politicians, he took a long soak in the local hot springs with them, regaling them with stories held dear by his people. He expressed interest in scaling the mountain and seeing the fabled llamagriffs in the flesh. Most of the politicians, eager to appease the king, simply smiled and nodded. But one particularly mirthful listener burst into uncontrollable laughter, eventually dying from the hysteria.\nNeedless to say, the location of llamagriffs in Myshupotamian legend were a bit less &lt;i&gt;specific&lt;/i&gt; from then on.</Text>

  <Text Key="435C1D10">Long ago, at noon on a bright day, Fulov Pepp was born. His family lived in a flowery cottage in Whispering Glen. His upbringing was humble but full of joy. His mother often read to him at night while sitting with him on a wooden rocking chair. Ironically, all that love produced the most bitter, hate-filled Sim Ravenwood had ever seen.\n\nFulov grew up to be a writer. It wasn't for the love of the craft or the enjoyment of the saccharine themes he employed. It was entirely because he loved manipulating the average Sim, who he saw as simple and easy to please. His first published work was about a llama starting a charity for wilting cowplants, and the books only grew more nauseatingly optimistic as he achieved success.\n\nBut perhaps the most important aspect of his legacy was his hatred for fellow writer Edward Talon-Crow. He would never have admitted it, but he &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/i&gt; Edward's works and was eternally jealous of his depth and writing ability. So, he dedicated the rest of his time to publishing extensive manifestos degrading Edward's character. This feud endured until the two writers' deaths, and perhaps even to this day!</Text>

The Schmapple mantra of "Ovens to the Power of You" and relentless improvement until we developed truly indestructible appliances? It all rings hollow for me. Life is just too beautifully imperfect to fall prey to hubris. Upon reflection, I rallied my team of trusted advisors to help me explore a deconstruction of those design ideals. What if the beauty of life and its many implements lies in the &lt;i&gt;fallibility&lt;/i&gt; of those implements? We sought a sleek, stylish, yet brooding style that guided us away from the brutal, technical perfection we've previously embodied. Sure, it breaks, unlike The Schmapple Oven. But doesn't everything, in some way, at some point? Let that thought stew for a bit.\n\nI humbly hope you find yourself as lost in wistful thought as I do while using this oven!\n\n'Til death (and beyond),\nVincent Schmapple</Text>

  <Text Key="1162B114">Club Eternity takes the saying "dance like no one is watching" both figuratively and...literally. If anyone knows how to party, it's the deceased. With a breathtaking, dark gothic aesthetic, this club's more Macabre patrons thrive and even Skeptics are convinced that Ghosts still know how to live.</Text>
  <Text Key="21AD0E7B">Club Eternity</Text>
  <Text Key="A8A55E99">This green-thumb-friendly manor is conveniently located in central Mourningvale. One of the standout features of this home is the attached greenhouse, which has been converted into a breakfast nook that looks out over the central plaza. This space is perfect home for any Sims interested in gardening...and the afterlife living.</Text>
  <Text Key="F7CA6EF2">Esther Gomes was already looking for a ghostly roommate when poor Zuleika met her end in a rather unfortunate Cowplant "accident" and also found herself looking for a new home in the same neighborhood. Now the two are sharing a home, and Esther is teaching Zuleika the ins-and-outs of ghostly living and career development working for Grim.</Text>
  <Text Key="A9ECCE8D">Izadi-Gomes</Text>
  <Text Key="57DF2A8E">Mourning Mist Manor</Text>
  <Text Key="C0928D22">Casket House lies nestled along the bog's edge. The air is thick but peaceful, interrupted only by the haunting whispers of Sims entering the afterlife. Many believe the house got its name due to the empty Casket inside, but in truth, it was first haunted by Catie Casket, a Ghost who finished her Unfinished Business and was Reborn in Willow Creek—or so they say. With its eerie charm, this lot promises potential for any brave mortal ready to make some Ghostly friends or any Ghost ready to start fresh in the life beyond.</Text>
  <Text Key="B89B5401">The Cozy Casket House</Text>
  <Text Key="B590F930">This empty plot of land, nestled amongst pastoral, rolling hills, is the perfect locale for Sims aspiring to live a simplistic, rural life. A family living here will find themselves just down the old dirt lane from their neighbors and always under the ever-watchful gaze of the Ancestor across the river.</Text>
  <Text Key="FB4C9E5F">Hay Hill Landing</Text>
  <Text Key="0F8ED21F">The Final Draught is a cozy establishment, welcoming all beings. The Draught's regulars come for the dimmed lighting, comfortable seating, and gentle tunes. However, the upstairs is often host to private events—most commonly, events for those saying goodbye to their loved ones. This is Ravenwood, after all!</Text>
  <Text Key="797AD8A4">The Final Draught</Text>
  <Text Key="410A6E2A">This rustic chateau has existed in its rolling countryside setting for over a century now. When the Aethers moved in it was renovated, and it's clear someone really liked the color pink. In a region that so often celebrates the Macabre, the wildflower gardens outside provide a cheery place to celebrate life in its many forms.</Text>
  <Text Key="D87B3B73">After a miscommunication with a pet Crow, Kai Aether found himself in a less corporeal form than expected. It's a story familiar to many families, but there's an unfortunate wrinkle to this story that has made things extremely stressful for not just Kai's husband, Ekade, but also for their son, Takama—you see, not only does Kai not seem to understand that he's dead, he also doesn't believe in Ghosts. Period. Awkward, right? But with the help of a local support group and with the love of his family, maybe Kai will start to see the light.</Text>
  <Text Key="D443D8A2">Aether</Text>
  <Text Key="8D4C3AE9">The Marigold Chateau</Text>
  <Text Key="392A9601">This large family cottage is perfectly situated on the river's shores, under the watchful gaze of the Ancestor. It's only a hop, skip, and a jump away from the nightly Moon Revelry festival as well! If that doesn't sell it, the wrap-around porch is the perfect reminder that sometimes it's good to slow down and enjoy the small things in life.</Text>
  <Text Key="7D13315A">Having tried being a ghost on for size, Radwan and Tziporah Gomes have decided that being a Ghost isn't for them—at least, not quite yet. Meanwhile, Radwan has his hands full keeping his clumsy wife from meeting Grim a little too soon. In the midst of all this chaos, their teenage child Zelmira has plunged headfirst into their own study of the afterlife after finding a tarot card on a walk one day. Now, Zelmira's embracing their inner Macabre side and finding unique connections in the family's past to a very special member of the Goth family. Things definitely seem to be getting a bit spooky for this household!</Text>
  <Text Key="872D1B85">Gomes</Text>
  <Text Key="F1DAFF56">Teardrop Cottage</Text>
  <Text Key="B5C028AE">It's Grim's office. He works here. While his personal crow should always be the employee of the month, Grim has decided he is the best at his job. He does own the place...and has been Reaping for centuries. Now Grim has opened up his practice to new Grimterns, eager to climb their way up the noncorporeal ladder.</Text>
  <Text Key="2CD6F425">HeadlessQuarters</Text>
  <Text Key="AC81ADCF">Everyone in Ravenwood knows about old Ravenwood Estate. It's one of the oldest buildings in the village, though it's been vacant for years. Locals whisper about its regal but oddly overbearing presence, the once fastidiously-tended garden turned wild, and the lovely abandoned greenhouse on the estate's grounds. Rumor has it this was once the summer home of a powerful Spellcaster and Tarot reader long ago. If a Sim comes along who can get past the flickering lights, foreboding sounds, and other inexplicable happenings inside, they'll have quite the fixer-upper...</Text>
  <Text Key="6239D0D4">Old Ravenwood Estate</Text>
  <Text Key="59294DA0">Eternal Hollow is Ravenwood's primary Cemetery. The main building is an intimate locale to say goodbye to the recently passed, and with plenty of graves and crypts still open, it'll continue to be a popular location for burials for years to come. Locals to Ravenwood know Eternal Hollow's pond is also one of the better places to find a Death Frog or the rare Bonefish. Whether a Sim is spending their forever here or just visiting, they will certainly feel at home in Eternal Hollow.</Text>
  <Text Key="4FDF978F">Eternal Hollow</Text>
  <Text Key="A16CF105">For decades, this home has housed the Specter family, but now its history is closely tied to Olive Specter, a widow many times over. This house, sits almost like a crow on its perch watching the Specter cemetery below and waiting for yet another skeleton to join the closet. (Or in this house's case, maybe the basement...)</Text>
  <Text Key="9A165886">The Specter family has an air of mystery to them; rumor has it that Olive's prior husbands all met unfortunate ends, which makes things rather awkward now that she's engaged to Layne Coffin, the founding and sole member of the band Withering Widdershins. Does Layne know his soon-to-be Specter spouse has skeletons in her closet? He's definitely not going to be asking too many questions about her son Nyon's mysterious parentage. Let's just say that maybe Grim's not keeping tabs on their household solely because of Olive's past loves.</Text>
  <Text Key="B0B87319">Specter</Text>
  <Text Key="9C159D02">Specter Family Manor</Text>
  <Text Key="7202FA76">Nestled at the highest vantage in the village, this historic building is the perfect home for any family hoping to get the full Ravenwood experience. Head down to the village square to enjoy any of the three local festivals, explore the abandoned houses, or stop by the haunted playground and introduce the kids to Freddy, everyone's favorite specter.</Text>
  <Text Key="BD2F0E4D">Crow's Perch</Text>
  <Text Key="E8B4378B">Another Ravenwood historical building that boasts a fascinating past. This home was originally built for Moppy. Yes, the goat. It's now vacant and the perfect home for any Sim moving to the region. There's lots to do and plenty of goat-laden architecture to ponder. Just don't be too unsettled if the Moppy statue's eyes glow at night...or if lights start flickering in the abandoned houses next door. It's all part of the aesthetic.</Text>
  <Text Key="12263218">Moppy Manor</Text>

The Moon Revelry festival takes place at the base of the Ancestor each night. During the full moon...clothing is &lt;i&gt;optional&lt;/i&gt;.</Text>

Those brave enough can make a wish and cast a coin into the well, but beware! It may backfire! Some say that gaining the Mark of Edith from the ghost child will not only guarantee a wish comes true but make that wish even more powerful.</Text>

The bell, a relic from the town's founding days, has always been a symbol of unity. Occasionally, lively debates flare between the Macabre and the Skeptical, though they never escalate beyond spirited discussion. The true purpose of these gatherings is the joy of connecting with fellow Sims. Legend persists that with each resonant chime, ethereal lights flicker around the tower.

  <Text Key="2E012098">The colossal monument towering over Whispering Glen is shrouded in mystery. Scholars believe it’s an effigy of a long-dead ruler carved into the cliff, but its origins remain unclear. Paranormal enthusiasts claim the full-moon "tears" are linked to the netherworld, while scientists argue they are merely floodwater runoff from the Baleful Bog. These tears have etched deep grooves into the stone, hinting at ancient rituals. Today, the Ancestor attracts nature lovers to its scenic waterfall and continues to inspire those who practice ancient rites during the full moon.</Text>
  <Text Key="76CB87B3">Long ago during a New Moon, a meteorite struck Whispering Glen, filling the sky with a breathtaking display of light and sound. Though no Sims were harmed, the event was witnessed from far. Centuries later, a gemologist discovered a glowing rock within the crater. Fascinated, he built an imposing castle around it, sealing his discovery within. Legend has it that the gemologist’s find was no ordinary rock. Some say it was cursed or used to create remarkable artifacts, like the Ancestor or Moppy’s glowing eyes. To this day, the castle stands shrouded in mystery, its secrets kept hidden from the curious eyes of locals.</Text>

Long ago, a group of medieval nomads, led astray by the bewitching tarot reader Lady Ravendancer Goth, were on the brink of starvation when they encountered a clever goat. Choosing to follow the goat rather than feast on her, they were guided to a land rich in resources. Grateful, the nomads settled there, naming the area Ravenwood after Lady Ravendancer’s Wood and honoring their savior with a fountain in Moppy’s name. Despite modern skeptics, the legend endures, and few dare to dismiss the ancient goat’s impact on the village.</Text>

Many objects are worthy of being Heirlooms—crafted items and artworks, chairs, tables, decorations, and more! Even toilets, believe it or not!

  <Text Key="5450FE33">Tarot is an ancient form of divination! One can tap into intuition, and through the readings, can find clarity or guidance. Inner desires come forth and the universe's influence takes hold! Amongst the Tarot community, there are whispers of a magical deck waiting to be found. A secret order has been performing rituals throughout Ravenwood, and their sacred site, a Tarot Tome Shrine, could reveal some truth to the rumors.</Text>

  <Text Key="5B4600C3">{0.SimFirstName}'s first instinct is to show kindness to the creature, gently outstretching a hand to signal that there is no threat.

In disbelief, {0.SimFirstName} removes {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} fist, causing a slimy goo to slop onto the ground. The creature cackles as it moves backward into the darkness, making {0.SimFirstName} feel unnerved, confused and a little sticky.</Text>
  <Text Key="BF665403">Sticky Stand-Off</Text>
  <Text Key="7510329E">The ghostly creature is surprised by {0.SimFirstName}'s actions. No one has ever tried to talk to them before...

  <Text Key="9ABDF2FC">{0.SimFirstName} is drawn to a dark and dusty wooden box. Once opened {0.SimFirstName} pauses, realizing there is nothing inside. A chilly sensation runs down {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} spine. {0.SimFirstName} can't tell if the feeling is from relief or horror. There is something about its emptiness...  Is it a metaphor or something more sinister? {0.SimFirstName} decides not to stick around to find out.</Text>
  <Text Key="93C535AF">{0.SimFirstName} nearly misses the iridescent box, as it almost looks translucent. The box feels light as a feather and smooth to the touch.

Its shape is ever changing, sometimes slithering like a snake, and other times prowling like a wolf. It's referred to by the name Dusty by the town-folk for reasons {0.SimFirstName} is unsure of.

  <Text Key="0932BC29">{0.SimFirstName} comes across what looks to be some sort of musical puzzle. Perplexed, {0.SimFirstName} deduces that {0.SimPronounSubjective} will need to play the correct sequence of notes on a dusty old piano that has taken up residence in the Crypt.

  <Text Key="2F1F4F38">{0.SimFirstName} placed the order for a replacement gravestone. Unfortunately, with no family to contact, the cost falls on the company. It's a rather hefty bill which makes {0.SimFirstName}'s boss not too happy.</Text>
  <Text Key="5F1A58E2">With a little elbow grease, {0.SimFirstName} made the grave look practically new! (Minus the crack, of course.) Before leaving, {0.SimFirstName} runs {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} fingers along the sigils. &lt;i&gt;"What strange carvings."&lt;/i&gt; A chill passes over {0.SimFirstName} before turning to leave.</Text>

Strange sigils lay carved into the sides and a sad aura envelopes {0.SimPronounObjective} as {0.SimFirstName} draws near.\n\nUpon a closer look, {0.SimFirstName} sees the grave sits caked in dirt, barely legible, and {0.SimFirstName} begins to wonder why no one has ever come to visit or bring flowers. Is it cursed or just forgotten? Either way, {0.SimFirstName} has to do something.</Text>
  <Text Key="E3671735">Grave Mistakes</Text>
  <Text Key="A2997F38">Grim's ego is clearly wounded, but at least we did it by the book. Hopefully Grim doesn't hold on to this grudge when {0.SimFirstName}'s time is up.</Text>
  <Text Key="3468F3B8">Report this Oversight!</Text>

As a new cadaver is rolled in, {0.SimFirstName} can tell something's... &lt;i&gt;off&lt;/i&gt; about it. {0.SimFirstName}'s been in the business long enough to know the subtle sweet aroma of a lingering soul, still left in the body. Looks like this must have been a botched job by Grim, or most likely - one of his new Grimterns. How might {0.SimPronounSubjective} go about handling this?</Text>
  <Text Key="0C6A6EAC">Beyond the Grave</Text>
  <Text Key="D150C033">{0.SimFirstName} shares a few kind words before beginning {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} process. Hopefully these mysterious deaths one day stop...although it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; good for business.</Text>

  <Text Key="66FD53C5">Sell This Information</Text>
  <Text Key="113A40EA">Not {0.SimFirstName}'s ghosties, not {0.SimFirstName}'s haunted house. It's best to just let dead things lie.</Text>

  <Text Key="F6CEFCA9">With the estate name in mind, {0.SimFirstName} was able to find the estate owners. &lt;b&gt;'Tricou.'&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;TRICOU?!&lt;/i&gt; Like that creepy broken grave?! Theories online claim Fricorith and Gvaudoin Tricou now haunt the residence, scaring off anyone who dares enter. Could they be responsible for the string of fright-wrought deaths on the property?</Text>
  <Text Key="DF0C3B48">A previous choice lends insight.</Text>
  <Text Key="7BE16EF8">Track Down These Ghosts</Text>
  <Text Key="5645B245">Another death has come in from off the coast, at the &lt;i&gt;House of Fallen Trees&lt;/i&gt; estate. Fright seems to take the life of just about anyone who walks through those doors. In fact, {0.SimFirstName}'s records show 3 deaths in just the past year! What could be so scary about a house? Could it be truly cursed?</Text>
  <Text Key="74F31547">Toe Tags</Text>
  <Text Key="06DD543A">It's hard to believe {0.SimFirstName} had the guts to step foot in that house, let alone exhume the burials. There's no sure way of knowing if the reunification worked, but there's already been word that the estate's paranormal activity has died down. A grave keeper did mention heightened activity at the cemetery, but that's probably just a coincidence, right? ...&lt;i&gt;Right?&lt;/i&gt;</Text>

  <Text Key="31F2ACE5">With almost an ethereal sense, {0.SimFirstName} was able to track down the ghouls responsible for this whole mess. But, like most ghost tales, these unfortunate events were never with malicious intent. There are just some Sims out there who can't handle the paranormal! It's hard to say why these ghosts linger here, but {0.SimFirstName} hopes that with certain ghostly behavioral adjustments the hauntings won't inadvertently take any more lives.</Text>

  <Text Key="72F8482D">Inform the Right Authorities</Text>
  <Text Key="8F804320">That previous case just keeps itching in the back of {0.SimFirstName}'s mind. {0.SimPronounSubjective} can't let it go. Apparently, records showed two registered plots located at that estate, House of the Fallen Tree. If {0.SimFirstName} were to use certain connections and job expertise, could {0.SimPronounSubjective} reunite these burials with the other family plots and end the hauntings?</Text>
  <Text Key="9CAAB5EE">Keep Your De-Composure</Text>
  <Text Key="204B6B03">A truly generous offer! {0.SimFirstName} should be wary not to do it too often, lest {0.SimPronounSubjective} bankrupt {0.SimPronounReflexive}. Even in death, debt follows.</Text>

  <Text Key="B37BB549">The Tricous were the original owners of the estate. Unfortunately, not a single relative remains alive. There's no record of foul play in any of the deaths; however, online thanatology enthusiasts claim otherwise. A lot of fingers point towards Jennicor Tricou as the main suspect in some truly dastardly deeds. The internet can really come up with some wild theories...</Text>
  <Text Key="00C8D771">Start with the Tricous</Text>
  <Text Key="A0DFCDAA">Further digging revealed quite a number of deaths on the grounds. Including an entire family, the estate's original owners. {0.SimFirstName} notices they all died under suspicious means. How tragic.</Text>
  <Text Key="A339613F">Dig In</Text>
  <Text Key="5BD352BC">It's probably best to leave it alone. Unless a detective comes knocking, what's the point of getting wrapped up in this?</Text>
  <Text Key="DEE8FED3">Leave it Alone</Text>
  <Text Key="4DC98A8D">It might not be {0.SimFirstName}'s job to investigate, but that doesn't mean it's not &lt;i&gt;somebody's&lt;/i&gt; job.</Text>
  <Text Key="D7CA9D2E">The morgue has been receiving deaths from off the coast, at an estate called 'House of the Fallen Tree'. Odd name. Their records are riddled with mysterious deaths dating back decades. {0.SimFirstName} is hesitant to dig any further. What if someone out there wants this to stay buried?</Text>
  <Text Key="B846E308">Buried With Work</Text>
  <Text Key="6A0FF20D">While that may work, or at the very least sound really cool, in movies, {0.SimFirstName} did not get a great response after egging on the ghoul. They live to tell the tale, but their office rests in pieces.</Text>
  <Text Key="20CAE9D6">Shout 'Do Your Worst!'</Text>
  <Text Key="0ADDEF06">Grim appeared, oddly with what seemed to be an intern in tow? He managed to wrangle the ghost into his pocket and poofed away. Problem solved?</Text>
  <Text Key="EFA432E3">Call in Grim</Text>
  <Text Key="28F69005">Fighting while dead at least takes the pressure off of a fight to the death. Luckily, {0.SimFirstName} has been hitting the gym. It didn't take long to overpower this ghoul and send them back where they belong.</Text>
  <Text Key="D1701ED4">Use Ghostly Powers</Text>
  <Text Key="29AD0495">{0.SimFirstName} kept chanting &lt;i&gt;'Jennicor Tricou...Jennicor Tricou'&lt;/i&gt; as the ghost shrieked in horror. {0.SimFirstName} carried on, reading aloud a list of names from Jennicor's family. Jennicor wailed and crashed out the window, never to be seen again.</Text>
  <Text Key="828D6F33">Invoke Her Name</Text>
  <Text Key="EBC80EA1">A ghost is haunting the funeral home! &lt;i&gt;How fitting...&lt;/i&gt; Either {0.SimFirstName} brought this on or someone in the morgue has been messing with something they shouldn't have. An angry spirit whips through the showroom, crashing caskets to the floor and shattering vases full of floral arrangements. {0.SimFirstName} has to stop them!</Text>
  <Text Key="83F55313">The Rest in Pieces</Text>
  <Text Key="CDEB3A09">Although the facts about revivals that {0.SimFirstName} has published are true, Grim is not happy about the implications that this will have on his Soul Quota. </Text>
  <Text Key="6058DC77">Revivals are on the rise.</Text>
  <Text Key="BBDF4A33">{0.SimFirstName}'s report is music to Grim's ears (if he has them). Looks like there is room for growth in this company after all! As long as this department keeps meeting their weekly Soul Quota, that is!</Text>
  <Text Key="BE81651B">Death is trending up... but needs to be higher!</Text>
  <Text Key="0E3713EB">The stats say that the most common way for Sims to kick the bucket is old age, and death by fire comes in second place. I mean, it makes sense that most Sims live out their life till the end, but no doubt it starts to get boring for Grim. Death trends are looking good, but {0.SimFirstName} notices another pesky stat about death revivals increasing over time. What should {0.SimPronounSubjective} put in the report?</Text>
  <Text Key="C5250FD9">Timely Demise</Text>
  <Text Key="E6459863">Sold! Congratulations to the highest bidder, which appears to be...Grim! Oh, that's awkward. The next run in at the coffee machine in the break room is no doubt going to be awkward.</Text>
  <Text Key="DE6EEC82">Sell information to the highest bidder.</Text>
  <Text Key="FEBA65B3">The news {0.SimFirstName} leaked on Social Bunny is gaining traction! No doubt this information is going to be trending soon! Wait a second... it's all gone? All of the links to Grim's reaping count are dead. Suddenly {0.SimFirstName} can &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; Grim's endless shadowy stare looming behind {0.SimPronounObjective}. Not wanting to become another statistic, {0.SimFirstName} decides to get back to work and hopes that Grim can forgive and forget.</Text>
  <Text Key="DD84C84B">Leak Grim's numbers online.</Text>
  <Text Key="7FA2F046">Due to a technical error, Grim's reaping count has become accessible. Looking at these numbers, {0.SimFirstName} is amazed! Grim's reaping count is insane! I mean, considering Grim has been doing these reapings for centuries, it can't be &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; surprising, but {0.SimFirstName} is still blown away and wonders who else might be interested in this information?</Text>
  <Text Key="C60C22A0">A Spectacle</Text>
  <Text Key="7D9B0927">Grim is impressed by {0.SimFirstName}'s initiative! Scouting the perfect location is in progress as we speak!</Text>
  <Text Key="27C3C485">Warn Sims of the danger.</Text>
  <Text Key="B50CA1C9">Advertise as a fluffy pet.</Text>
  <Text Key="94C8EF39">Stats say that Death by Killer Rabbit is not trending as high as it could be. This gives {0.SimFirstName} an idea! What if Grim could start a petting zoo featuring these fluffy little monsters? This idea could certainly increase the stats! But how could we promote this endeavor? Surely we would need to warn Sims of the potential danger...or do we?</Text>
  <Text Key="327E9C6B">There's Mortal Life.</Text>
  <Text Key="5466DC2B">{0.SimFirstName} approaches the Ghosts and explains that while they can't be aimlessly floating about, {0.SimFirstName} would love to interview them. The wayward Ghosts gasp, honored and flattered by the proposition. They happily agree, resulting in an eye-opening chat and a short break for {0.SimFirstName} to enjoy.</Text>
  <Text Key="35CF4200">Interview</Text>
  <Text Key="39710DE0">{0.SimFirstName} chooses to investigate and handle the problem by the book. The wayward Ghosts are caught by surprise, seemingly embarrassed that their master plan was thwarted. In a last-ditch effort, the lead Ghost tries to convince {0.SimFirstName} to let them stay by doing the missing thumb magic trick and finishing with enthusiastic jazz hands. Unamused, {0.SimFirstName} tells them to go back to where they belong and then continues to complete the routine checks.</Text>
  <Text Key="E89ACADD">Investigate</Text>
  <Text Key="AF08B87D">As {0.SimFirstName} is in the middle of {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} routine checks, a big red Warning appears. Apparently there are some wayward Ghosts milling about, which is an odd occurrence so close to the portal. {0.SimFirstName} is curious of their true motives but wonders whether they will be straight with {0.SimPronounObjective} and tell the truth.</Text>
  <Text Key="BFAE3EBF">The Other Side</Text>
  <Text Key="826FA4E2">{0.SimFirstName} proudly walks out after the full hour, looking a little worse for wear but still in one piece. {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} coworker stares at {0.SimFirstName}, awkwardly scratching the back of their head before reluctantly agreeing to honor the bet. Ah, who cares about the potential permanent damage that an hour in the Netherworld might cause? At least {0.SimFirstName} isn't cleaning the employee bathroom today!</Text>
  <Text Key="B4B01C5C">Stay Full Time</Text>
  <Text Key="24B0062D">Though thrilling, the Netherworld is no place for the living. Bathroom duty isn't that terrible and is much better than whatever may have happened if {0.SimFirstName} stayed in there any longer!</Text>
  <Text Key="B8893122">Leave Early</Text>
  <Text Key="5A9547BC">A coworker has bet {0.SimFirstName} that {0.SimPronounSubjective} wouldn't be able to last an hour in the Netherworld. This particular coworker isn't the type to back down, but whoever can stay the longest and wins, is off the hook for cleaning the employee bathroom. Not one to shy away from a dare, {0.SimFirstName} considers what to do next. </Text>
  <Text Key="1A63FE1A">Live a Little</Text>
  <Text Key="D05485C6">It was a tough choice, but at the end of the day, this task had to be done. Unfortunately it took a lot out of {0.SimFirstName} to manage this work, making {0.SimPronounObjective} feel exhausted and uncomfortable.</Text>
  <Text Key="903B8F74">Stir the Bog</Text>
  <Text Key="2663B1EE">{0.SimFirstName} went with {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} gut and checked on those pesky Netherworld seals. Whoever did this job last didn't fully repair the rifts, resulting in some concerning leakage!

  <Text Key="2528F20E">&lt;i&gt;An excerpt from the essay "The Stairs of Ruin" by Edward Talon-Crow, published one week after being dumped by San Myshuno furniture mogul Pernilla Lunvik, who famously ran off with her spellcaster paramour.&lt;/i&gt;\n\n"We ascend the stairs of life and death unendingly, every ounce of effort lost to the ether as we toil forever. When is this loss ever more painful than in the form of unrequited love? Few things appall me more than watching my efforts be taken, stomped in the dirt, and left to wither by someone who once claimed to love me.\nBitter are the days I've survived recently. The air in this accursed city reeks of shady industry, broken dreams, and more heinously, &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt;. I once beheld modern magic as a joyous advancement for Simkind, but now the wicked art leaves me wishing for a simpler age. I daresay we have ascended these stairs to unsustainable heights! Mark my words, there is little good to come of spellcasting, only melancholy!\nPerhaps I shall find my respite in the quiet hills of another horizon, far away from this city of smog-tinged sadness."</Text>

You can hover over each icon in the Soul's Journey to learn more about each reward, which includes new social interactions, bonus satisfaction gains, and more!</Text>
  <Text Key="A06A53A0">As a living Sim with the reward tier Dreams Fulfilled unlocked, you will have the option to choose to Rebirth at the Moment of Death. Make sure to choose wisely as there will be no option to return once the decision is made. If you are a Ghost Sim, you can Rebirth at anytime by visiting Baleful Bog in the Mourningvale neighborhood of Ravenwood. Choose to Rebirth by selecting a spot in Baleful Bog and select &lt;b&gt;Rebirth&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="239F8222">If you'd like to add new Bucket List or Unfinished Business goals to the list immediately, you can interact with a Computer or Journal to &lt;b&gt;Write Goal&lt;/b&gt; and have a goal picked specially for your Sim. Or, if you'd like to narrow down the goal to come from a specific category of goals, you can &lt;b&gt;Write Goal from Category&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nIf your Sim has the Chased by Death or Embraced by Death trait, has recently witnessed a Sim die, or attended an Afterlife Anonymous meeting, they have a new perspective that allows them to &lt;b&gt;Write the Perfect Goal&lt;/b&gt;, which gives you the ability to hand-pick the goal your Sim will explore!</Text>
  <Text Key="D245ED2F">Bucket List or Unfinished Business goals are lifelong goals that will generally take a bit more time or effort to complete compared to most Aspiration goals, though they may range in difficulty!\n\nThese goals will generate gradually over time, as your Sim lives their life. The types of goals your Sim receives will often be based on their traits/experiences. If your Sim would rather go in a different direction, you can &lt;b&gt;Scrap Bucket List or Unfinished Business&lt;/b&gt; on the Computer or Journal to reset their goals.</Text>

  <Text Key="64356C6F">While Ghost Sims by default change color based on their mood, you can now choose to &lt;b&gt;Set Ghost Color&lt;/b&gt; for any Ghost Sim! This allows the Ghost Sim to maintain a specific color, regardless of their mood.</Text>
  <Text Key="0F2294D2">Ghost Sims can harness their full ghostly potential by unlocking powers and rising through the ranks in Ghost Mastery! To explore available perks, open the &lt;b&gt;Ghost Mastery&lt;/b&gt; section in the Simology panel. As Ghost Sims use their unlocked abilities, they will earn experience points and gradually advance their tier in Ghost Mastery, affecting the living in more formidable ways!</Text>
  <Text Key="A0ECEC5C">There are now two ways to become a ghost: Create a Sim and Dying at the moment of death!\n\nIn Create a Sim you can create a Ghost by selecting the cause of death next to the Aspiration trait icon.

Once you have created a Ghost in Create a Sim, you will be able to access the Ghost Sim's urn in their inventory!</Text>
  <Text Key="93261163">Keep an eye on Ghost Stamina! Overusing abilities will gradually drain a Ghost Sim’s stamina, causing them to appear more faded. You can track your Ghost Sim's Stamina in the Ghost Mastery panel.

There are no real endings – only transitions – as you move between life, afterlife, and even &lt;b&gt;Rebirth&lt;/b&gt;. </Text>
  <Text Key="0A569EEB">Getting Started</Text>
  <Text Key="F138E783">Once a Sim dies, their remains can be customized to fit that Sim's personality! By interacting with their current urn or tombstone, you can select &lt;b&gt;Display as...&lt;/b&gt; to choose a style for their remains. After that you can go to Build Mode and use the Design Tool to change the swatch of the model, if you'd like.\n\nYou can also &lt;b&gt;Turn On or Off Auto-Switch&lt;/b&gt; when interacting with an urn or tombstone. By default, Sim remains placed outdoors will display as tombstones, and change to urns when placed indoors. This is the behavior seen when Auto-Switch is turned on. Turning off Auto-Switch allows you to set either type to stay as, regardless of whether it's placed indoors or outdoors.</Text>
  <Text Key="6DDCD5E5">Crypts can be purchased from Build Mode and are also found in each neighborhood of Ravenwood. To add Sim remains, select the Crypt object and choose &lt;b&gt;Urn and Gravestone Inventory&lt;/b&gt;, which allows you to drag a Sim's Urn or Gravestone directly into the Crypt.\n\nSims can tell &lt;b&gt;Ghost Stories&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Nap&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;WooHoo&lt;/b&gt;, and even embark on adventures when they &lt;b&gt;Explore the Underground Crypts&lt;/b&gt;! When exploring, a Sim will disappear inside and can discover valuable rewards while on their quest. However, be warned, creepy encounters with otherworldly beings are also possible when descending into the Crypt.</Text>
  <Text Key="D584A728">Gravesites are objects that can be purchased in Build Mode, allowing you to slot Sim remains onto them and decorate them as you see fit. It's a lovely way to honor a loved one that passed with mementos, or a sneaky way to make fun of a deceased not-so-loved one with something they'd hate.\n\nOnce it's placed, you can drag an urn or tombstone onto the plot, which will designate that gravesite for that Sim's remains. You may also place a burial casket on a gravesite, and slot the remains into the casket!</Text>
  <Text Key="F09D6521">The &lt;b&gt;In Loving Memory: A Timeless Capture&lt;/b&gt; portrait object is another special way to commemorate those who have passed, even after they're already gone. Search for it in Build Mode or place it from the Life Event Activities category. Once placed, Sims can interact with it to Update Frame and Flowers. More importantly, they can Assign Sim to Memorial Portrait. They simply need to know someone who recently passed. This will display the passed Sim as they were at the moment of their death. To ensure this image doesn't change, simply select the portrait to Lock it.\n\nWhen paired with a &lt;b&gt;Memorial Display&lt;/b&gt; that has already been dedicated or a &lt;b&gt;Gravesite&lt;/b&gt; that has an &lt;b&gt;Urn&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Tombstone&lt;/b&gt; slotted into it, the portrait object will automatically update to the applicable Sim's portrait.\n\nPro Tip: For further customization, photos from your Sim's Inventory can also be dragged into the portrait object at any time as long as it's not currently Locked.</Text>
  <Text Key="C93C4876">&lt;b&gt;Memorial Displays&lt;/b&gt; are a touching way to honor and remember passed Sims as well. There are two which are available in Build Mode. Just search "Memorial Display" or look for them in the Life Event Activities category. Once placed, select the &lt;b&gt;Memorial Display&lt;/b&gt; and choose to Dedicate Memorial Display to either a Household or a specific Sim. If you change your mind, you can always select it again to Remove Memorial Display Dedication. Once dedicated, Sims can interact with the &lt;b&gt;Memorial Display&lt;/b&gt; to Reminisce about Deceased or to Talk to.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Memorial Displays&lt;/b&gt; can also be decorated. Try placing an Urn of someone who has recently passed, the &lt;b&gt;Whispering Wren Messenger Statue&lt;/b&gt; to let your passed loved ones know how your Sims are feeling, some flowers, incense, or the &lt;b&gt;In Loving Memory: A Timeless Capture&lt;/b&gt; portrait object. There isn't a wrong way to memorialize your loved ones.</Text>

  <Text Key="FE97F0DD">Grief is a journey, and with every path, there are bumps along the way. You’ll notice that &lt;b&gt;Denial&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Holding It Together&lt;/b&gt; Grief Types have a chance to transition to &lt;b&gt;Anger&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Blues&lt;/b&gt; during the grieving period, so being proactive about Grief is beneficial to a Sim’s wellbeing.\n\nGrief always finds its way to acceptance eventually. However, it &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; change a Sim’s personality when all is said and done…either for better or worse, depending on how &lt;b&gt;Grief&lt;/b&gt; was dealt with. Dealing with &lt;b&gt;Grief&lt;/b&gt; is a natural part of life. With the right support, a Sim can come out stronger on the other side!</Text>
  <Text Key="67C271EB">A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;Grief Type&lt;/b&gt; can be found in the Traits section of the Simology Panel. This is where you'll see whether your Sim has the &lt;b&gt;Anger&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Blues&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Denial&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;Holding it Together&lt;/b&gt; Grief Type.\n\nThe Grief Type gained by a Sim is based on Sim Traits and (if applicable) their relationship. For example, Macabre Sims are less likely to gain Grief, and if they do, you will most likely find them with Denial or Holding It Together Grief Types. Grief will have its own set of behaviors for your Sim to navigate.</Text>
  <Text Key="247884D0">When a Sim experiences a difficult period in their life, &lt;b&gt;Grief&lt;/b&gt; may surface. Tough situations, such as &lt;b&gt; Loss of a Family Member or Close Friend&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Loss of a Pet&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Divorce&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;Getting Fired from a Career&lt;/b&gt; can be trigger points for a Sim to begin the &lt;b&gt;Grieving Process&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nNot all Sims surface Grief in the same way, and not all Sims will gain Grief. It can show itself as &lt;b&gt;Anger&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Blues&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Denial&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;Holding it Together&lt;/b&gt;. Each &lt;b&gt;Grief Type&lt;/b&gt; comes with its own challenges and opportunities to grow!\n\nWhen a Sim gains Grief from losing a loved one, Grief is often delayed, taking a few days to take hold once the mourning period has ended and those Moodlets have subsided.</Text>
  <Text Key="7A625330">Sims can cope with Grief by engaging in uplifting, creative, or proactive activities. A Sim can &lt;b&gt;Attend Grief Counseling&lt;/b&gt;, an interaction found by selecting the grieving Sim.\n\nCertain Sim activities are more helpful in coping with Grief, depending on the Sim’s Grief Type. Specific activities can be found by hovering over the Grief Icon in the Traits section of the Simology Panel.</Text>
  <Text Key="9B57B3C1">Grief</Text>
  <Text Key="992BA9DA">Funerals provide an opportunity to gather, grieve, celebrate, and give Sims a chance to say their final goodbyes.\nThere are multiple ways to plan a Funeral:\n\n&lt;b&gt;Phone&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Computer&lt;/b&gt;: To plan using the Phone, select the Sim’s Phone, then the Social Icon. You can then choose Plan Funeral from the list of options. While using a Computer, you can find Plan Funeral from the Household section of the Pie Menu.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Urn or Gravestone&lt;/b&gt;: Select the deceased Sim’s Urn or Gravestone and choose Plan Funeral from the Pie Menu. As an added perk, planning a Funeral from the Urn or Gravestone will automatically set the &lt;b&gt;Deceased Sim&lt;/b&gt; role in the Funeral Event panel.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Calendar&lt;/b&gt;: Select the Calendar, which will bring up the Calendar UI. Here you can select a specific day to plan the Funeral in advance. Once you are set on the day, select Add Funeral Event from the list of events and choose the time you would like it to start.\n&lt;i&gt;Using the Calendar feature is the only way to plan a Funeral Event in advance, otherwise the Funeral will begin once the event selection is complete.&lt;/i&gt;</Text>
  <Text Key="52D19EED">There are objects found in Build Mode that are designed to work well with Funerals. Place the &lt;b&gt;Funeral Podium&lt;/b&gt; during the event, which when selected, houses many Funeral interactions. &lt;b&gt;Burial Caskets&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Gravesites&lt;/b&gt; can store Sim remains and allow for Funeral interactions to be performed. Place a &lt;b&gt;Memorial Display&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Memorial Portrait&lt;/b&gt; and dedicate them to the deceased. If you would like a more celebratory event, place the &lt;b&gt;Memorial Cannon&lt;/b&gt; to give the Sim the most epic send off!\n\nAlthough Guest Sims will grieve freely during a Funeral, interactions like &lt;b&gt;Call Over Guests&lt;/b&gt; can help bring attention to certain activities that you would like to complete. &lt;b&gt;Funeral Activities and Interactions&lt;/b&gt; can be found by selecting &lt;b&gt;Sims&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;Funeral Podium&lt;/b&gt;, and the &lt;b&gt;Urn or Gravestone&lt;/b&gt; while a Funeral is in session.</Text>
  <Text Key="D88828C2">When in the Funeral Planning UI, you can assign Sims to specific event roles. The &lt;b&gt;Deceased Sim&lt;/b&gt; is the Sim that is being honored and the &lt;b&gt;Host Sim&lt;/b&gt; is the Sim that is currently selected when planning the event.\n\nYou can add &lt;b&gt;Guest Sims&lt;/b&gt;, who are Sims known to the Deceased, and if you are concerned about the crowd size, feel free to add some &lt;b&gt;Hired Mourners&lt;/b&gt; to the mix. An &lt;b&gt;Entertainer Sim&lt;/b&gt;, once invited, will play an Instrument when it is available on the lot chosen for the event.\n\nSelect the Guest Attire &lt;b&gt;Color&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Style&lt;/b&gt; to define how Guests should dress for the event. If nothing is selected, Guests will arrive in their set Formal Outfits.\n\nSelect &lt;b&gt;Activities&lt;/b&gt; for Sims to complete during this event. A serious, formal event might mean that &lt;b&gt;Moment of Silence&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Lighting Candles&lt;/b&gt; are the desired vibe, while a more laid-back celebration of life could call for &lt;b&gt;Dancing&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Giving Toasts&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nOnce everything is set, all that’s left is setting a &lt;b&gt;Location&lt;/b&gt;. Funerals can be held on a &lt;b&gt;Home Lot, a Cemetery, or other Venue Lots&lt;/b&gt; that feel like they are the right fit for the type of Funeral being planned.</Text>
  <Text Key="93C6BE21">Funerals</Text>
  <Text Key="C638A7F6">The Grim Reaper can be friendly, dependable, and...romantic? Sims can gain a deeper relationship with Grim by &lt;b&gt;Socializing&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Flirting&lt;/b&gt;, and even &lt;b&gt;WooHooing&lt;/b&gt;! As Sims increase friendship with Grim, more socials become unlocked. Once a Sim has become &lt;b&gt;Good Friends&lt;/b&gt; with Grim, they can even call Grim to hang out.</Text>
  <Text Key="304CFD1A">Sims can even &lt;b&gt;Try for Baby&lt;/b&gt; with Grim, no matter the gender of the Sim! &lt;b&gt;Grimborn Sims&lt;/b&gt;, the offspring of Grim, are born with a distinct &lt;b&gt;Scythe Birthmark&lt;/b&gt; and will live a little longer than normal Sims. When Grimborn Sims have children, the &lt;b&gt;Grim's Descendant&lt;/b&gt; trait is passed on to mark Grim's legacy.</Text>
  <Text Key="75FDAF34">Sims may battle it out in a game of life or death when they &lt;b&gt;Challenge Grim to a Game&lt;/b&gt; when a Sim has died. In order to do this, the game must already be placed on the lot before death occurs. After a Sim has died, and Grim has shown up to do his business, select a living Sim in the Household, choose one of the supported games and challenge Grim!\n\n&lt;i&gt;Supported games include: Chess, Darts (Get Together), Don't Wake the Llama (Get Together), Foosball (Get Together), Basketball (City Living), Ping-Pong (Discover University), Hopscotch (For Rent), Horseshoes (Outdoor Retreat), Bowling (Bowling Night).&lt;/i&gt;</Text>

  <Text Key="D390A26C">Once an object has been made an Heirloom, your Sim can engrave a personal message on it to leave their mark for future generations! They can also &lt;b&gt;Claim Higher Value&lt;/b&gt; on the object to ensure it increases in value each time it's passed on.</Text>
  <Text Key="75803EF0">Heirloom Objects can be passed down via a Will when your Sim dies. Once your Sim has a Will created, you can interact with the Heirloom and select &lt;b&gt;Pass on Heirloom to...&lt;/b&gt; to open the Heirloom Object inheritance menu. You must then choose a worthy Sim to inherit the object.\n\nThis can also be done by interacting with an existing Will in your Sim's Inventory. For more information on Wills, refer to the Wills section of Lessons!</Text>
  <Text Key="0413C598">Heirloom Objects are designated objects that have special value to Sims and may be passed down through generations of Sims via Wills. Many objects are worthy of being Heirlooms—crafted items and artworks, chairs, tables, decorations, and more!\n\nTo designate an Heirloom Object, select an eligible item and choose &lt;b&gt;Make Heirloom&lt;/b&gt;. This will designate your current Sim as the original creator of that Heirloom. If inherited, your Heirloom will always commemorate the original creator of the heirloom!</Text>

  <Text Key="EA2B3152">Since this is an &lt;b&gt;active career&lt;/b&gt;, you may choose to either send your Sim to work alone, or you may join them at HeadlessQuarters, the location of Grim’s office.</Text>
  <Text Key="6A5B8E29">The &lt;b&gt;Reaping Test Mannequin&lt;/b&gt; in the office can be selected to &lt;b&gt;Practice Reaping&lt;/b&gt;. This action, when completed before going out on assignment, can contribute to a smoother &lt;b&gt;Soul Collection&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nOther ways to prep for a Reap include &lt;b&gt;Research Assignment&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Perform Scythe Maintenance&lt;/b&gt;. Doing these activities before traveling to location prepares a Sim for their job and makes it less likely that the reap will fail.</Text>
  <Text Key="3CFF7480">Working in the Reaper Career also has its surprises. You may load into the office lot and find that mischievous ghosts have sabotaged the headquarters! Another day might require multiple reaps of Sims who have experienced a catastrophic event!\n\nOne constant, however, is the &lt;b&gt;Weekly Souls Quota&lt;/b&gt;. Be sure to keep up on collecting and releasing Souls. You can learn about the Soul Quota by selecting a Computer at the office and choosing &lt;b&gt;Check Soul Quota&lt;/b&gt;. If the Soul Quota is achieved over the week, the Sim will be rewarded with a gift from Grim's Box-O-Fun(eral)!</Text>
  <Text Key="1403D292">There are a few objects at the office that a Sim in the Reaper Career will use almost daily. The &lt;b&gt;Scry Bowl&lt;/b&gt; is where a Sim will learn the assignment of the day and is usually the first stop for a Sim once entering the lot. The &lt;b&gt;Netherworld Portal&lt;/b&gt; is where souls are released, usually done after each reaping.</Text>
  <Text Key="BA124FA4">Once on the job, a Sim in this career will be tasked to complete many different &lt;b&gt;Goals&lt;/b&gt;. Once each goal is completed it will count towards the progress for the day.\n\nA Sim is awarded &lt;b&gt;Bronze, Silver, or Gold&lt;/b&gt;, depending on the amount of tasks completed. This will impact the Sim’s &lt;b&gt;Career Performance&lt;/b&gt; for their career level. Keeping performance up and completing &lt;b&gt;Promotion Tasks&lt;/b&gt; outlined in the &lt;b&gt;Career Panel&lt;/b&gt; will ensure that your Sim is promoted to the next level.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F695730">The &lt;b&gt;Reaper Career&lt;/b&gt; is a new active career where a Sim will team up with Grim himself to perform reapings and other deathly tasks to keep the afterlife functioning.\n\nJoin the Reaper Career by selecting the Sim’s Phone and locating the Business Icon. Once selected, choose Find Job from the list.\nA Sim can also join this career by selecting Grim and choosing &lt;b&gt;Ask to Become Reaper&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>

  <Text Key="09DC513A">The &lt;b&gt;Burning Soul&lt;/b&gt; is a coveted trait given as a reward for completing the last tier of the Soul's Journey, &lt;b&gt;The Big Picture&lt;/b&gt;. As a ghost, you can enjoy additional benefits such as being able to use less Ghost Stamina when performing Ghost Mastery abilities!\n\nAfter Rebirth, you will be able to choose one personality trait from your Sim's previous life through the &lt;b&gt;Recall Past Life&lt;/b&gt; self-interaction! Additionally, the &lt;b&gt;Peer Into Soul&lt;/b&gt; interaction available on mirrors, allows your Sim to recover some other traits acquired from their previous lives. Children, toddler, and infant Sims will also benefit from immediate boosts, with certain Milestones and Developmental Skills unlocked right from the start!</Text>
  <Text Key="8F0BF3F4">Reborn Sims also retain certain connections from their previous lives. Your Sim may recognize former family members or Soulmates, gaining special relationship bits that allow them to rebuild familiar bonds. New interactions will give your Sim the chance to rekindle these relationships. These connections help your reborn Sim pick up where they left off, making it easier to reestablish important relationships!</Text>
  <Text Key="87CE0761">After choosing to Rebirth, whether at the Moment of Death or by visiting Baleful Bog, you will be taken to Manage Worlds to select your new household! The choice is completely up to you, choose to Rebirth into the same family or a completely new one!</Text>
  <Text Key="230ED23F">Once you've selected a new household and lot to move into, you'll enter Create a Sim to customize your new Sim. The &lt;b&gt;Resemble Past Sim&lt;/b&gt; allows you to adjust your Sim's facial structure, skin tone, and eye color to closely match the appearance of the previous Sim. Additionally, &lt;b&gt;Play with Genetics&lt;/b&gt; enables you to modify your Sim's look based on the genetics of members from their new household.</Text>

  <Text Key="C595D9E2">Soul's Journey: Rebirth</Text>
  <Text Key="24A2BEFF">The Soul's Journey is a new reward system to guide Sims through the later stages of life, offering self-fulfillment, closure, and even Rebirth! For living Sims, the Soul's Journey becomes available once they reach a young adult, while ghost Sims can start their Soul's Journey early as a teen!\n\nLiving Sims have a Bucket List, that can be filled with goals they hope to fulfill before they die. Ghost Sims will have Unfinished Business, consisting of goals that they're aiming to achieve before moving on. Completing goals from this list will earn your Sim progress through their Soul's Journey track.</Text>
  <Text Key="7F6E72E2">In addition to fulfilling goals from the Bucket List or Unfinished Business, the Soul's Journey can also progress by completing things like Aspirations and Wants! Whether it's working toward life's greater purpose or satisfying everyday desires, each achievement counts towards a Sim's Soul's Journey!</Text>
  <Text Key="49BF4231">Soul's Journey: Overview</Text>
  <Text Key="2AB18F06">Learn about &lt;b&gt;Tarot&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Tarot Collecting&lt;/b&gt;, and the &lt;b&gt;Order of Lenore&lt;/b&gt; by locating the &lt;b&gt;Tarot Tome Shrine&lt;/b&gt; that can be found in each neighborhood of Ravenwood. Once a Sim has interacted with this object, they are now able to find and collect &lt;b&gt;Tarot Cards&lt;/b&gt; hidden throughout the world.</Text>
  <Text Key="EF043352">To jump right into Tarot without finding the cards, the &lt;b&gt;Bibbity-Basic's Tarot Deck&lt;/b&gt; can be purchased from Build Mode. Once placed, this object can be added to a Sim's Inventory for use.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F42D650">The Tarot Tome Shrine will reveal key Sims who are happy to reward Tarot Cards to your Sim in exchange for completing &lt;b&gt;Favors&lt;/b&gt;. Cards are also hidden all over Ravenwood and can be found by exploring the &lt;b&gt;Crypt&lt;/b&gt;, digging in specific areas, and using a little &lt;b&gt;Intuition&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nOnce all 26 cards are collected, the deck can be created by selecting the card stack in the Sim Inventory and choosing &lt;b&gt;Create Deck&lt;/b&gt;. Lady Ravendancer Goth's Tarot Deck is now complete and can be used while in the Sim's Inventory.</Text>
  <Text Key="4C90DF41">If you ever get stuck searching for a card, navigate to the &lt;b&gt;Household Collections&lt;/b&gt; panel, which can be found by selecting the gem icon in the Sim's Inventory. In the section marked &lt;b&gt;Tarot Cards&lt;/b&gt;, hovering over an empty card slot will reveal a cryptic hint as to where this specific card can be gained.</Text>
  <Text Key="6787C35A">With the deck in the Sim Inventory, select the &lt;b&gt;Tarot Deck&lt;/b&gt; object to complete interactions. With the &lt;b&gt;Bibbity-Basic's Tarot Deck&lt;/b&gt;, a Sim can &lt;b&gt;Draw a Daily or Nightly Reading&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Offer Tarot Reading&lt;/b&gt; to others.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Lady Ravendancer Goth's Tarot Deck&lt;/b&gt;, which is gained through collecting cards (and also available in the Reward Store) allows for a few extra special interactions. With this deck in a Sim's Inventory, they can also perform &lt;b&gt;Meditative Divination&lt;/b&gt; which allows them to &lt;b&gt;Summon Lady Ravendancer&lt;/b&gt;, perform &lt;b&gt;Affirmation Healing&lt;/b&gt;, and perform &lt;b&gt;Divine Slumber&lt;/b&gt; interactions.</Text>
  <Text Key="72134CA8">Tarot</Text>
  <Text Key="862A74B1">This skill can be gained by reading &lt;b&gt;Thanatology Skill&lt;/b&gt; books, &lt;b&gt;Reading Theories on&lt;/b&gt; Sim mysteries on a Computer, and by &lt;b&gt;Looking up Historical Deaths&lt;/b&gt; on a Bookshelf. This skill can also be gained in the &lt;b&gt;Reaper&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Undertaker&lt;/b&gt; careers.\n\n&lt;i&gt;If The Sims 4 Discover University is installed, a Sim can also take elective courses to learn more about Thanatology, do research on an &lt;b&gt;Archive Machine&lt;/b&gt;, and debate &lt;b&gt;Afterlife or After Living&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="2FF6DCBA">&lt;b&gt;Thanatology&lt;/b&gt; is the study of Death and the practices associated with it. Sims can master this skill, giving them new interactions such as &lt;b&gt;Discuss Deadly Enigmas&lt;/b&gt; with Grim, learn how to &lt;b&gt;Speak a Dead Language&lt;/b&gt; and cook &lt;b&gt;Soul Soup&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="6EE3CE7A">Thanatology Skill</Text>
  <Text Key="A8EC36A2">If your Sim or Household is inheriting something via a dead Sim's Will, you should receive a copy of their Will in the mail shortly.\n\nOnce your Sim receives the Will, they must &lt;b&gt;Read the Will Out Loud&lt;/b&gt; for it to take effect and receive whatever was inherited. Simoleons and Dependents should arrive immediately, and you will receive any inherited Heirloom Objects in your Sim's Household Inventory. </Text>
  <Text Key="232FF942">A Will is a document that allows your Sim to pass on their assets to their current household members, or other households, depending on what's being passed down.\n\nWhen your Sim starts their Will, they'll receive one directly in their inventory. Wills can be started on a Computer with the &lt;b&gt;Start Will&lt;/b&gt; interaction. Your Sim can also start their will by hiring an Inheritance Lawyer service on the Phone!</Text>
  <Text Key="1CA02056">Certain designations made in Wills will only go into effect if the Sim is the last Sim in the household to die.\n\nThe following Will designations will go into effect when the individual Sim dies, regardless of the rest of the household:\n• Passing on Heirlooms\n• Funeral activities &amp; wishes for Sim remains\n\nThe following Will designations will &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; go into effect if the Sim who wrote the Will is the last Sim aged Teen or older in the household to die (which means there are no other Sims aged Teen or older left in the household):\n• Passing on Simoleons\n• Moving Dependents to a new guardian Household</Text>
  <Text Key="3D781076">Once a Will is created, it can be updated by interacting with it directly. As for inheritance, Sims can select individual Sim recipients for their Heirloom Objects. They can also decide where Simoleons are sent, whether it's Charity or to another Household. They can also designate a new home household for their Dependents (Sims of Child age or younger, and pets).\n\nFor personal wishes, Sims can decide what they would like their remains to be housed in, and the style of their gravestone or urn. They can also indicate their wishes for funeral activities.\n\nYour Sim can also leave a personal message that will be read to recipient Sims, along with an associated emotion to really drive home the message you're choosing to send to the next generation!</Text>
