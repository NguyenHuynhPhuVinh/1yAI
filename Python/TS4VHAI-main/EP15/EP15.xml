  <Text Key="25423D70">While I love our current living situation, I hope it's more of a temporary arrangement. I don't want to rent forever. I like to picture us in a beautiful home, down by the water, with floor to ceiling house plants! Liên can even renovate all the rooms if she wants! I think it could be nice, for all of us.</Text>
  <Text Key="6571183A">There are spirits all around us! They live in the trees, the water, the sky! It's just something I know deep down to be true. And while there are plenty of good spirits, there are also evil ones, haunting your lampshades and breaking your sinks. You should be careful how you treat people in this life, you never know what they might do to you in their next one.</Text>
  <Text Key="48C4D15F">I've always wanted to go into conservation, but I never took the leap. I knew I was good at programming and having a stable job felt more comfortable. The dream is still there though. That's probably why I'm always visiting the Sanctuary or spending time outdoors. I just want to make our world a better place for all creatures.</Text>
  <Text Key="D20E630E">If you know the tale of Khun Mae, you'll know why tassels are so special to this area. I always feel such a deep connection when I happen upon one, it's like her spirit is gifting it to me directly. Be sure to look around or simply relax on the beach, you never know when Khun Mae may leave you something special.</Text>
  <Text Key="F744DEB1">I'm quite fond of the Screaming Gecko. It's a lovely place to make new friends and share delicious food. And the hot tub! Talk about making some steamy encounters over late night drinks, &lt;i&gt;amiright&lt;/i&gt;? You should check it out! It's like our not-so-secret-secret spot for Tomarang hangs.</Text>
  <Text Key="B351A3D4">Do you ever hear screams in the dead of night? A high shrill sound, piercing the silence, jolting you awake?! The eerie air thick with fear and humidity, as the breathy shriek pauses before announcing itself once more. You look around. You check your doors and windows. Nothing. A bead of sweat rolls down your back. Again it haunts you! Is it aliens descending from above? A being lurking in the shadows? A neighbor in need of help? No. It stings your ears once more. It's down right chilling. You pass by an open window - wasn't this shut before? Maybe, maybe not. You carefully approach, heart pounding, ears ringing. As you look at the windowsill, hesitantly waiting for a ghoul to appear, you see...a gecko.</Text>
  <Text Key="572BEDA2">Growing up, I was taught to greet my parents and grandparents with what we call "Mano". I would bow my head and place their hand on my forehead. It always warmed my heart having that special something between us.</Text>
  <Text Key="739F147B">I can trace my family lineage all the way back to the days of Khun Mae. I love knowing how deep my roots go, it makes Tomarang truly feel like home.</Text>
  <Text Key="DC4601C4">Hidden truths are all around us. With enough trust in one another, people are more likely to share what's deep within. Sure, if you snoop around you could find things, but isn't it also nice to just make conversation with the people around you?</Text>
  <Text Key="D3310D2D">Of all the places in Tomarang, Beard Beard Cove is my favorite! I've heard rumors that pirates once camped out there after a storm left them waterlogged. I've yet to find proof, but keep your eyes peeled. I know there's &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; out there.</Text>
  <Text Key="6848EF4B">I plan on retiring, really I do. I just don't want to admit that I'm at that age. I still have my wits about me. I still have time to use the 'ole noodle before I lose my marbles. I just can't figure out where the years went. How did time escape me?! When did my girls get so grown, and I so old? Don't put things off until the end. Live your best life today, that's what I do.</Text>
  <Text Key="CDBE6D0D">My obsession with Moon Bears is simple. Arturo literally means "Bear". It's a part of me. It's who I am. And if that seems silly, maybe it is. I've spent so many years with Chánh, it's possible his whimsy is rubbing off on me...</Text>
  <Text Key="A89AA81F">Promise you won't think of me differently? I really became an astronaut in hopes to uncover the truth about Moon Bears. I know they're out there, I just need to do some more research. Even if I have to go up there myself, I will find them before I meet my grim fate.</Text>
  <Text Key="53072D1E">I once did a talk about intergalactic solar systems with Avelina Lunvik. Her discoveries helped shape so much of my work. This is probably classified, but in my youth I spent some time on Sixam! &lt;i&gt;Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; place. No cell service though.</Text>
  <Text Key="0364264C">Sometimes an astronaut just needs his space. &lt;i&gt;Thi would be so proud of me for that one.&lt;/i&gt; But in all seriousness, I enjoy the focus and silence of the lab. I need to keep my mind sharp! Can't let it turn to jelly in my old age.</Text>
  <Text Key="592AFAB3">I'm not one to share my feelings but you've shown me it can be really rewarding. I tend to struggle revealing my true emotions. Someone has to lead, you know. Someone has to be the caretaker. I need to remind myself that feelings are not weakness. I should share with my son more often. He needs to know he's loved. Everyone does.</Text>
  <Text Key="C0EBBA18">Kasem's father, Yao, and I were never married. I always liked a little spice, a little spontaneity. Our love was deep and open to whatever the universe threw at us. I just never expected it to throw in such an early departure. I like to think he's the one always breaking my toilet. That's why I leave extra fruit outside. No need to worry about sugar in the afterlife.</Text>
  <Text Key="CEEB13F0">I didn't even flinch when Kasem asked to change his pronouns. Some languages have 30 pronouns, did you know that? Why should I care if it brings him such joy? My Noi. I often wonder if giving him that nickname made him feel small. He has such a big heart, I hope he knows that while he's still my little boy, he's meant to achieve great things in this life.</Text>
  <Text Key="22E49CC7">I just don't use chopsticks. Why would I give up the mighty spoon?! It's a powerful and useful tool. Take it from an elder, don't change what isn't broken.</Text>
  <Text Key="786328C2">The Spirit House in front of my home is for the pĭi. I make sure to provide daily nourishment so they stay happy. Kasem thinks I'm silly, but I swear it's kept the spirits out of my home and away from breaking my toilet.</Text>
  <Text Key="16C9D828">Sometimes I want Arturo to retire. I know it's selfish! But we're old! You can't blame a man for wanting to spend his final days with his best friend. He's smart, but he can also be so dense. Tell him to come home soon, okay? He can't work forever.</Text>
  <Text Key="76438E0F">Back when I was skippier than a rock, I met my husband in Selvadorada on an expedition. Those ruins are no joke, I was nearly pierced by a poisoned dart! Arturo actually saved me. I had fallen for him, quite literally, over a ledge and into his arms. We traveled a lot together after that, but we finally settled down here. I had told him it didn't really matter where we ended up, his moon can be seen from anywhere! And dang it, I was right!</Text>
  <Text Key="F9146876">I know I can be a bit of a goofball, but Thi really kicks it up a notch! I don't always understand half of what she's talking about, but she's a good sport about my jokes, so I can be a good sport about hers. Just watch out when she gets her cringe on, you might get smacked in the melon with an awful joke or two if you stand too close!</Text>
  <Text Key="584A4548">You should know, fishing can offer peace and serenity - two things that are hard to come by in a house full of people! Unless you find a babbling brook, those can be just as talkative!</Text>
  <Text Key="E8A3F511">The secret to a good life is finding your passion. Rewards come to those who do. For instance, my passion is fishing. And look! Life rewards me with an abundance of fish friends every time I'm on the water. Arturo taught me that though the river is quick, patience and appreciation are key.</Text>
  <Text Key="77348CF1">Honestly, I wasn't born with this name, I chose it. Kasem can mean "happiness" or "pure joy", something that once felt unobtainable for me. Sometimes you just have to make your own happiness, or in my case become it!</Text>
  <Text Key="2623B905">No one knows this but, I tend to think about the Broman Empire on like a &lt;i&gt;daily basis&lt;/i&gt;. It just impacts everything! Social structures, political systems, taxes. If you really sit down and ponder it, you can just about follow any topic all the way back to that major moment in history. Even The Great Sloth Invasion was brought on by the downfall of the Broman Empire! Like, how can you not think about that?!</Text>
  <Text Key="3580EEB1">Nin and I never went on a real honeymoon. We just kept putting it off, trying to save more to make it extra special. What she doesn't know is that I've been secretly planning a trip, just the two of us! I hear Tartosa is quite romantic...I just have to make the finishing arrangements before I can surprise her!</Text>
  <Text Key="5AAC8A03">Our son is born from science, isn't that neat? We named him after Koh Sahpa's tigers. We hope it makes him feel strong! We also found it fitting since he kept growling as an infant.</Text>
  <Text Key="FD239B0A">Nin is my gem, my sapphire. It's sappy, I know. But she brings a special light to my life. I could not face this world without her, but that's not really a secret is it?</Text>
  <Text Key="A73A81FE">It's true! I'm a phoney! I strut around in stylish outfits and influence others to bust their wardrobe woes but the real truth is - I LOVE SWEATPANTS. It's all you really need. A good, comfy, scrappy old pair of sweats. That's my inner truth, and yet I can never wear them. It would ruin my brand.</Text>
  <Text Key="EB1D42A7">Despite being loud and lively, Thi is definitely hiding &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;. I'm no snoop, so I'm not even sure how I'm going to figure it out. It's just a feeling I have. If you find out, you don't have to tell me. I want her to open up when she wants to. But keep an eye on her for me, yeah?</Text>
  <Text Key="3E40F40F">I know Alon believes in the legends of Tomarang, but I'm a bit of a skeptic. I mean, I don't even believe in werewolves. If I've never seen one, how can I be sure they really exist? I just focus on what's in front of me and leave the tall tales to my dear Alon. </Text>
  <Text Key="85748DBA">I became a vegetarian after a chicken nugget clucked at me. No it wasn't undercooked, it was my dad having a laugh. But still! How haunting. I never wanted to eat meat ever again. That poor nugget...</Text>
  <Text Key="9F4C21A8">It's my job to track the trends and cultivate a solid fashion sense, but, if I'm being honest, fashion "don'ts" don't really exist. You're style is yours. I think the only fashion faux pas would be wearing nothing at all!</Text>
  <Text Key="CFD1BF64">Legend says Khun Mae was temporarily enchanted by the Watcher to transform into a Tiger. She was gifted with ferocious strength and fearsome agility. Could you imagine becoming a tiger? You'd never encounter it today, but it's still pretty wild to think about.</Text>
  <Text Key="D10CA69B">Long ago when Beasts descended upon Tomarang, even after being transformed into a tiger, Khun Mae was not strong enough to face them herself. The Beasts destroyed a third of the land before she even returned with help. With the amount of damage, they never rebuilt and simply allowed nature to return and heal the grounds. I for one enjoy the extra foliage, it's peaceful to be surrounded by so much nature.</Text>
  <Text Key="0D028029">Don't you know? Tomarang is &lt;i&gt;known&lt;/i&gt; for its relationship with Tigers. Our history dates back to our early ancestors, when sims would live side by side with these majestic creatures. It's our responsibility to preserve their existence you know, just like it was back then. I always frown upon those who try to sneak in at night. Imagine waking a tiger from their beauty sleep! A good way to get eaten if you ask me.</Text>
  <Text Key="C004B7E1">During a perilous time, Khun Mae, before she became the Great Mother of Tomarang, accepted a quest to save the village. An elder set her on a path to seek the great Watcher, a mystical being rumored to dwell in a land not far from here.</Text>
  <Text Key="202FCF24">I once watched a nail biting round of marbles at the playground in Morensong. Poor kid played for keeps and lost all his marbles! I always wonder what happened to him. Losing your marbles is never a good thing.</Text>
  <Text Key="38D432D3">You can't say a word. Promise? I may already know about the honeymoon Kasem is planning. It's not my fault! I got home from the gym early one day and overhead him on the phone. I refuse to spoil the occasion though. He's worked so hard on this and it's so incredibly sweet. I want him to still enjoy surprising me, even if I may not be &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; surprised as I should be.</Text>
  <Text Key="035B099C">Kasem's mother and I disagree when it comes to parenting. She can be a bit strict, which isn't really my style. Sud is so little, I just want to provide a gentler approach. But, all that said, I do try to remind myself that Bua raised Kasem, and he turned out wonderful. So it's probably okay, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="56B37089">If I'm not at the gym, you'll probably find me with my nose in a book! I've read &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;. From &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Swings&lt;/i&gt;, to the Dusk Glow trilogy, to &lt;i&gt;Gentlemen Corgi: A Memoir&lt;/i&gt;. If it's something that can be read, I must read it! I even found a really old copy of &lt;i&gt;The Log of the First Voyage of Beard Beard the Pirate&lt;/i&gt; at a yard sale. Can you believe that? What a find! I couldn't help myself, I read the whole thing right there at the table. I do feel bad I never paid for it, but once I had finished, it seemed silly to buy it... Anyways, that book's plot packed &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; the scandal!</Text>
  <Text Key="A0B5E5CF">As a child, my mother would make roti with condensed milk and sugar. It was so sweet and delicious! Sadly, I lost her recipe while moving around from place to place. I know she added a secret touch, I just hope one day I can remember what it was.</Text>
  <Text Key="39EC15A1">I think if I had a super power it would be napping. I can nap &lt;i&gt;anywhere&lt;/i&gt;. One time, I fell asleep in a bush! Just right there, in some nature. Honestly, nap where you must! Getting some good rest is important... Who cares if it's on the ground? Just watch out for twigs, they tend to poke.</Text>
  <Text Key="5EB595A4">Tell you my deepest secret? If I did that I'd also have to introduce you to my friend Grim. Listen, I will neither confirm or deny my secret agency. I'm just trying to keep my family safe. They don't need to worry about me all the time.</Text>
  <Text Key="EDAF8FD1">I feel really strongly about embracing my cringe. It's like artistic expression! It's a release of emotions! A POSE OF POWER! Ok maybe it's not that serious, but it is a dabbin' good time. Some ladies like a dab of perfume, I like a dab of the 'ol humerus-es. If you're not down for the cringe, what &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; you down for?</Text>
  <Text Key="F88B0C9E">I sometimes sneak into my family's unit and move furniture around. Last time, I just moved everything 1cm to the left. The amount of things my dads bumped into that day! PEAK comedy.</Text>
  <Text Key="938FA5AA">My dream is to own a motorbike. That way I can new scoot goof around town. It would make trips to the store a lot quicker too. I can't just lug bags of groceries home, my ice cream would melt! This way I can scoot &lt;i&gt;aboot&lt;/i&gt; and make it home in time for Sunday sundaes in this heat. My favorite sundae is my own concoction, "Goof Foot" ice cream. Don't let the name fool you, it just has loads of toppings.</Text>
  <Text Key="0D7BE1A4">There was once a rumor going around that break-ins were rampant and small trinkets were being stolen from people's homes. The truth is, I owned a very mischievous cat named Bubs who would commit B&amp;E's, or "Bubbin' &amp; Entries" as I liked to call them. He would steal small tokens and keep them in his stash under the floorboard. I wasn't gonna turn him in! Do you know what they do to overly curious cats with sticky paws!? So I kept it to myself. Haven't told a soul until now.</Text>
  <Text Key="0C7C89CC">Truth is, I don't really know how to fix anything. Anytime a tenant needs maintenance I just buy a replacement instead. Last week my tenant's sink was spraying water all over the bathroom and I just bought a new one! I couldn't make the water stop! No matter how many times I hit it with a wrench, the fountain of fury just kept getting worse! I know it probably costs me more, but do you know how boring those fixer upper books are?!</Text>
  <Text Key="D9D9D82C">I'm trying to be the best property manager I can be, but I have to admit, I'm not perfect. Did I, at one point, &lt;i&gt;semi-accidentally&lt;/i&gt; cause a mold issue in the bottom unit to get the tenant to move out? Yes. And I feel terrible about it! But you must understand, they kept letting their dog pee on the floor! At least... I &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt; it was the dog... Regardless, I didn't want smelly floors anymore!</Text>
  <Text Key="08BC144B">I wasn't always so responsible. I partied too much and stayed out all night. I had this wild idea to become a DJ. It was a bit chaotic, the lifestyle. I often wonder where I'd be had Zhafira not needed me. It's funny what life throws at you. I could barely handle my own needs, now I have to be responsible for tenants &lt;i&gt;AND&lt;/i&gt; a teenager!</Text>
  <Text Key="4299BC8D">Money can get tight, but we make it work. Renting out the space below doesn't always cover everything, which is why I'm also a barista. I told Zhafira not to worry about helping with bills, but she seems to really enjoy babysitting. I'm concerned it's because she can snoop around people's houses while the kids are napping but I'm too afraid to ask. Plus, I like when she buys me lunch from time to time.</Text>
  <Text Key="D8E9C932">It's not really a secret around here that our parents passed. But not many realize that we carry on our father's name. Last names can be a funny kind of thing. Ours is polynymic with a patronymic, which is really just a fancy way of saying we're named "Cahya's daughter".</Text>
  <Text Key="9E92474E">I want to move away when I finish school. It's something I've been mulling over for quite some time, but I think I'm fully committed to the idea now. I just haven't told Vanesha yet...To be honest, I'm scared it will break her heart! We aren't very close, and maybe that's my fault, but it would mean leaving her all alone. I just want to travel. I want to explore! Maybe try university. I don't know the details quite yet, but I know I want to try new things and I can't do that here. My whole family has lived here for generations, but without them around, it doesn't really feel like home anymore. I just hope Vanesha will forgive me.</Text>
  <Text Key="8FD33528">Yes, I broke into Bella Goth's house but DO NOT tell my sister! I had to skip school to even be able to and she'd be furious...mostly about the break-in, but probably about the school too. Listen, I didn't take anything! I just wanted to see what it was like. There are a lot of skeletons in that family's closet. Like, literally.</Text>
  <Text Key="0628F803">Most people would say that sneaking around and not minding my own business is a form of acting out. But what if I just like it? Is it really so bad to be nosy? I enjoy the discovery! Don't &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; want to know about everything around you? Interesting people come in and out of the unit downstairs, I'm just intrigued by them.</Text>
  <Text Key="B3097BEF">I'm not afraid to microwave water! I just &lt;i&gt;choose&lt;/i&gt; not to. The kettle is a perfectly normal way to heat water.</Text>
  <Text Key="E65EE6D2">It's not a secret that our parents died. However, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a secret that Vanesha gave up becoming a DJ to take care of me. I don't think she knows I know. It's really strange to watch someone completely upend their entire life just to accommodate you.</Text>

  <Text Key="6B57743D">One day, a baby bird sprouted from the bud of a leaf. This was a strikingly gorgeous organism, which desired to escape the tendrils from once it came, and soar through the sky in freedom! Each day, it grew a new wing to which it hoped would let it soar. Over time, strange creatures came to observe these transformations, but it paid them no mind, continuing the pursuit of its goal. Soon after, it felt its roots leave the ground, and the sky drew nearer! Oh what a glorious day, all that effort had blossomed. But what's this? Those strange creatures from before were closer than ever, brandishing sinister auras. Plunk! The poor bird was submerged into a new prison, not quite the earth as it was before, but soil nonetheless, with a smooth surface surrounding it. As the days went by, the creatures would gawk at the bird's futile struggles to fly, and it grew weaker. Finally, when the baby bird's time had reached its end, the dream for flight was passed on to its descendants, as it let out one last burst of energy to send its spirit out to the wind, starting the cycle once again.</Text>

  <Text Key="76D38330">Upon entering the cave, {0.SimFirstName} notices a small tunnel towards the back wall. Could this be the entrance to another cave? A cave within a cave...&lt;i&gt;cave-ception&lt;/i&gt;. Eager to find out, {0.SimFirstName} makes {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} way into this dark passageway.</Text>
  <Text Key="06A319BE">Hidden Tunnel</Text>
  <Text Key="C337FD6D">The natural beauty of this hidden grotto is awe-inspiring. It's not every day {0.SimFirstName} can take in these views! </Text>
  <Text Key="5070AB96">It's hard for {0.SimFirstName} to enjoy the cavernous views when several eyes begin to appear in the rock wall's many crevices. Are they... &lt;i&gt;watching {0.SimPronounObjective}?&lt;/i&gt;\n\nNo, no. It must be {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} imagination. Either way, maybe it's time to leave. </Text>
  <Text Key="FB669200">Stay Put</Text>
  <Text Key="3959C35E">As {0.SimFirstName} climbed up the rocky handhold, a tiny hand reached out to hold {0.SimPronounPossessiveIndependent}. &lt;i&gt;What even was that?!&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe view may have been cool, but that creature's quest for affection has left {0.SimPronounObjective} with several heebies and quite a few jeebies.</Text>
  <Text Key="35170787">Not a creature to be seen, but there was a small prize for {0.SimFirstName}'s bravery! A tassel sat atop the rocks, laying in a small patch of moss. A delightful find for {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} collection.</Text>
  <Text Key="751FDC7B">Make the Climb</Text>
  <Text Key="AEA963F6">Exiting the tight enclosure, {0.SimFirstName} is encompassed by a large cavern with light streaming through a small opening in the rocks above. It's a little oasis all to {0.SimPronounReflexive}.\n\nStaying put and soaking in the beauty is certainly an option, however, a large stack of rocks resembling a stairway of sorts catches {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} eye. &lt;i&gt;Fair warning- cave rocks tend to make excellent homes for tiny creatures.&lt;/i&gt;</Text>
  <Text Key="A621FB88">Keep Going</Text>
  <Text Key="94BC48D1">At this point, {0.SimFirstName} can only rely on sounds and vibes to find {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} way out. The cave entrance has entirely disappeared from view, but with a few more steps a light can be seen in the distance. Surrounded by damp walls, {0.SimPronounSubjective} can't wait to get out of here.</Text>
  <Text Key="3689AACD">The whispering sounds intensify and almost feel like... &lt;i&gt;they're getting closer?&lt;/i&gt; A cold, musty gust of wind picks up from the same direction, tousling {0.SimFirstName}'s hair. Goosebumps ripple across {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} skin and every hair stands on end.\n\n&lt;b&gt;G-G-Ghosts?!&lt;/b&gt; {0.SimPronounSubjective|xxUpper} turned around and ran in the opposite direction, not sticking around to find out! </Text>
  <Text Key="289E7873">As {0.SimFirstName}'s call reverberated across the cave, the source of the mystery sounds is revealed—&lt;i&gt;bats!&lt;/i&gt; The once sleeping creatures begin to flutter about and in one giant synchronized mass, swoop down a passageway into the darkness.\n\nRelieved and unharmed, a new sound fills the air: laughter. &lt;i&gt;"Can you believe I thought I heard whispering ghosts?"&lt;/i&gt; {0.SimFirstName} is left feeling a little silly, and in awe of this cave's many secrets.</Text>
  <Text Key="3E768C63">Call Out Into the Darkness</Text>
  <Text Key="4134AD15">{0.SimFirstName} took a deep breath and concentrated on the strange sounds. Turns out, there was no whispering! It was just {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} breathing! Apparently stumbling around in the dark is a bit of a workout.\n\nWith that mystery solved and no desire to figure out what might still be lurking in there, {0.SimPronounSubjective} decided to make for the exit; that's enough cave time for today.</Text>
  <Text Key="04F95725">{0.SimFirstName} inhales sharply, holding {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} breath and tensing every muscle. Listening, waiting. The sounds are unchanged, but {0.SimPronounSubjective} also can't seem to place what they are. Thoroughly unnerved, {0.SimPronounSubjective} decided to book it before anyone or &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; notices {0.SimPronounObjective}!</Text>
  <Text Key="87200794">Take a Deep Breath and Listen</Text>
  <Text Key="19BD08BD">{0.SimFirstName}'s eyes struggle to adjust to the cave's darkness. All {0.SimPronounSubjective} can do is stumble around, arms stretched forward, hoping not to trip over any rocks. A faint sound suddenly catches {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} attention—skittering, squeaking and... is that... &lt;i&gt;whispering&lt;/i&gt;?? Frightened, {0.SimFirstName} freezes in place. Could someone or &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; be in the cave with {0.SimPronounObjective}? An animal? A... ghost??</Text>
  <Text Key="CFE5F1FF">Did You Hear That?!</Text>
  <Text Key="A180070A">Try to Decipher It!</Text>
  <Text Key="F10718E6">The drawings depict the story of a battle fought long ago, of beasts, tigers, and people.\n\nThe Great Mother, embracing her alternate form as a tiger, found the tiger pack she had been searching for fetching water from a trickling stream. Asking for forgiveness and begging for their help, she promised her people would care for all tigers until &lt;i&gt;"the moon became the sun."&lt;/i&gt; They agreed to lend aid. Upon their return to the village clearing, a fierce battle ensued between the tiger pack and the wretched beasts that had been ravaging the land. Together, they began to push back on the invasion, but as time passed, The Great Mother could feel her powers waning.\n\nJust when it felt like the tides were turning for the worse, something unexpected happened: an elder mistakenly made his way into the open. A beast caught sight and lunged right for him! In a moment of sacrifice, the Great Mother dove between the two, using the last remnants of her powers to save her elder. With a slash from the beast, Great Mother was split in two - a human form, and a tiger form. A piece of her soul remained within her cat counterpart. In fear of this revelation of power, the beasts retreated back into the depths of the forest.</Text>
  <Text Key="43E1535B">While looking over the carvings, another etching catches {0.SimFirstName}'s eye. It's newer than old but older than new; A heart hanging from the talons of a parrot in flight with some initials marked inside. &lt;i&gt;PCT &amp; JWBB&lt;/i&gt;. Whoever they were, they must have been madly in love to brave any potential pirates lingering nearby. These waters were not always safe... but love &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; make people do wild things.</Text>
  <Text Key="26C56DF9">Admire From a Safe Distance</Text>
  <Text Key="4311F254">There's only so much time {0.SimFirstName} can spend staring at cave art before it all starts to just look like &lt;i&gt;rocks&lt;/i&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="90F7A8CB">{0.SimFirstName} took this moment to feed {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} artistic soul. How many Sims get the chance to study ancient art in person? What a rare and insightful opportunity for any creative mind!</Text>
  <Text Key="7E79BA0C">Locals have always ventured into Beard Beard Cove to soak in both the beauty and the history.

  <Text Key="05C7736A">Beautiful Carvings</Text>
  <Text Key="22FD9AA3">{0.SimFirstName} pressed ahead over the rocks, stumbling and sliding along the way. Once on the other side, {0.SimPronounSubjective} started to congratulate {0.SimPronounReflexive} on a job well done. Looking around for what's next, {0.SimPronounSubjective} had a sudden realization—this is a dead end!\n\nWith a groan, {0.SimPronounSubjective} headed back towards the entrance. What a wasted adventure; {0.SimPronounSubjective} didn't even get to see anything cool.</Text>
  <Text Key="1DCAC669">{0.SimFirstName} carefully made {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} way across the rocks, choosing the safest looking spots to step and sometimes downright crawling, but {0.SimPronounSubjective} did it!\n\nOnce reaching dry land, {0.SimPronounSubjective} continued forward taking in all of the cave's beauty. Eventually, after many twists and turns, {0.SimPronounSubjective} found {0.SimPronounReflexive} outside again, grateful to not have to backtrack over the wet rocks. Who knew caves have so many entrances!</Text>
  <Text Key="09BEECEF">Continue Forward Across the Slippery Rocks</Text>
  <Text Key="CC814C4F">{0.SimFirstName} made a running leap for the ledge, and... missed. {0.SimPronounSubjective|xxUpper} hit the wall hard and slid back down onto the cave floor, leaving {0.SimPronounObjective} wet, sandy, and bruised. That didn't quite go as planned!\n\n</Text>
  <Text Key="2194494B">{0.SimFirstName} looked the wall up and down, carefully plotting out a course of sturdy looking hand holds. {0.SimPronounSubjective|xxUpper} slowly made {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} way up, hand over hand, until hoisting {0.SimPronounReflexive} onto the ledge. It was narrow, but relatively sturdy. So back against the wall, {0.SimPronounSubjective} shuffled forward, eventually coming to a small opening. &lt;i&gt;"Well, I've made it this far," &lt;/i&gt; {0.SimPronounSubjective} said quietly to {0.SimPronounReflexive} and crawled through.\n\nBlinking away the sunlight, {0.SimFirstName} seems to be on a small platform, overlooking the water in the direction of Koh Sahpa. The crystalline waters glisten in the sunlight as fish make their way through it. Birds are soaring through the air and nearby trees, chirping wildly. The city looks picturesque in the distance, a living postcard. What an amazing little spot!</Text>

  <Text Key="270AF4E7">Conservation efforts work towards restoring habitats for endangered species and preventing negative external forces from causing harm!

  <Text Key="982F3678">Like most members of their genus, tigers have various forms of communication. Because of their flexible larynx and hyoid apparatus, they can't purr like your typical house cat, but it does give them what they need to let out a ferocious roar!

Scent marking and tree scratching are used as a silent way to let other tigers know this area is claimed.\n\nWhile cute, tigers are wild animals and should not be approached.

Without any provisions at the forest's edge, the tiger pack withdrew to seek sustenance elsewhere.

  <Text Key="8B5D5D55">Abandoned Smeagie</Text>
  <Text Key="B37C9F4D">On my morning walk not too long ago, I nearly tripped over a small, lonely dog meandering down the road. There was no sign of his owner, just a name tag engraved with "Smeagie" attached to his collar. I really did feel bad for the poor fella, out there on his own. But... I left him. I just couldn't bring myself to take him home with me! There was something... &lt;i&gt;off&lt;/i&gt; about his eyes... his piercing blank stare, it still haunts me.</Text>
  <Text Key="A8ED2C1D">Moo-hoo!</Text>
  <Text Key="5F09E935">Back in the day, I wanted to help out the store I worked at, so I brought in my Cowplant to attract customers. You know, spark some interest with something dangerous and exciting! I didn't know it would get so out of hand. A bigger Cowplant meant more customers, so nightly feedings were a must. It grew and grew, and as it grew, it wanted more. I couldn't supply its demands, so it began EATING customers! It even ate the owner! I knew my Cowplant had to be stopped, so I enlisted help in making sure it was sent to a secret place where it could never hurt another Sim. I couldn't let my Cowplant just take over the world. That was one mean, green monster.</Text>
  <Text Key="F1366C22">In a Pickle</Text>
  <Text Key="18B7AC5E">I truly, deeply, irrevocably, hate pickles. I just do! I &lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; them. They're so sour in the most face-contorting way. And yet, I still eat them. I eat them because sometimes my friends or my family will say &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; don't like pickles, so I take them! I just wanted to be helpful, feel useful for once. Maybe it was also to prove a point. I didn’t want people to think I was the type of person who hates pickles! And now I take on the burden of the pickle... &lt;b&gt;everyone&lt;/b&gt; thinks I love them. Every birthday I end up with pickle memorabilia, monthly pickle club memberships, homemade pickles, even pickles imported from alien planets. It never ends! Now all I have is a closet full of pickles and a stomach full of lies.</Text>
  <Text Key="CF99462F">Sock It to Me</Text>
  <Text Key="45AF00EF">A secret like this should never get out. It's one the public would be up in arms over! Or should I say, up in &lt;i&gt;feet&lt;/i&gt; over? I'm just a collector. It's no big deal. Sure, it's collecting socks, and sure it's collecting socks that aren't mine, but how is that a crime? I find them in the Lost &amp; Found at different places around town, it's completely harmless! I just love the patterns, the fabrics, the ankle height. Argyle, polka dot, stripes. Ankle, knee high, crew. Mismatched or a pair, they are a delight!</Text>
  <Text Key="91FA2C14">Gummy Tummy</Text>
  <Text Key="DF18CDC0">Since the dawn of time, gummy bear pancakes have been regarded as a delicacy enjoyed by all. That notion ends today. I don’t care if I’m the only one that thinks this! I will meet Grim on this hill alone! &lt;b&gt;Gummy bear pancakes are disgusting!&lt;/b&gt; The gooeyness of the bear and the fluffiness of the pancake just don't work together! And oftentimes, the bears just burn or remain gelatinous, a hard chew within an otherwise light and airy breakfast bite. Everyone would think I'm crazy if they knew. Ever since I was small, I pretended to enjoy these gummy goobers as it brought smiles to my family's faces. The guilt of crushing their happiness was too much, the possibility of alienating myself with this opinion too grand. And now you know, but it must stay between us. Could you imagine the potential outrage over such a controversial topic?!</Text>
  <Text Key="A360FAF1">None of Your Biscuits</Text>
  <Text Key="058DADB9">It's been said my family are descendants of Lord Reginald Wainscott Stickywyck von Dosenwald. Before his nautical voyages, it was rumored that he had several relationships throughout his early years. I've traced my ancestry back enough that I can almost find a connection that could link us together. Which seems pretty definite to me. But I don't want word to get out! I'd hate to be treated differently just because my ancestor was the 37th Earl of Biscuit! I just... want to be treated normal, like everyone else.</Text>
  <Text Key="FE9BCB36">Tiger Tantrum</Text>
  <Text Key="9FAD0622">The Sanctuary in Tomarang has been open for as long as I can remember. As a small child, I would beg to visit every weekend. One visit in particular, I saw a small cub stumbling around. At that moment, I knew I wanted to take him home with me. I screamed and kicked and cried, begging for a baby tiger of my own. My parents thought it would be a good idea to get me a pet cat instead. I named him Mr. Tiddlywinks. And he looked just like a tiger! Oh, how I loved him. And then one day, my good 'ol kid brain decided it was time for Mr. Tiddlywinks to return to the forest. Never teach a child Rehabilitation and Release unless you specify you shouldn't do it to your house pets! I like to imagine Mr. Tiddlywinks is living high and mighty these days with his tiger pack. He was a menace, but he was my menace. Just… don’t tell anyone I abandoned my cat in the forest! I was just a kid, I didn’t know any better!</Text>
  <Text Key="1A32EB73">The Relentless Allure of Grilled Cheese</Text>
  <Text Key="12AFEA43">When I was very young, I had a strict teacher at school, Mr. Cousland, that seemed to enjoy assigning way too much homework, and giving grades that were way too low. He was a royal pain! One week, I happened to have grilled cheese for lunch a few times. Mr. Cousland came up to me during lunch and told me I should be careful. If I eat too many grilled cheeses, it would change me forever. And he said of all the people he knew, I would be the one most likely to fall down that slippery slope. I scoffed in his face and told him he was full of it, which earned me detention &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; extra homework. For years, I didn't believe him. Until one day I felt it, after having grilled cheese for lunch, dinner, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a midnight snack, the sensation hit me like a load of bricks. It was calling to me, the golden, glistening, cheesy, crunchy delicacy. Like it was floating in the sky and begging me to fly to it. I wrested control of myself at that moment. But I couldn't believe it, Mr. Cousland was right about grilled cheese, and he was right about me. He knew my weakness, and now so do you.</Text>
  <Text Key="08278278">Not so Merry</Text>
  <Text Key="0A5361F4">When it comes to receiving gifts, I'm much harder to please than most. What can I say? I just have unique tastes! Regardless of my personal pickiness, there are also a lot of mediocre (or even straight up terrible) gifts out there. So yeah, maybe I &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; repurpose a few of those disappointing gifts I received. I turned them into gifts for others! Sometimes I even give the gift back to the person who gave it to me, after enough time has passed. It's just efficient, and they hardly ever notice. You know what they say, one Sim's trash is another Sim's treasure! Just, uh, maybe keep this to yourself. I wouldn't want anyone to know I'm a serial re-gifter!</Text>
  <Text Key="C84E4AC5">Belle of the Eyeball</Text>
  <Text Key="C346CC7D">There are these rings I see folks wearing around town. They're... odd, to say the least. It's not just how they look. It's how they &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt;, if you know what I mean. They appear to be looking at me, and only me, every time I see them. The eyes &lt;i&gt;follow&lt;/i&gt; me. Listen, it wouldn't be such a big issue if only one other Sim had this ring... but they're everywhere, at least to me. And when I close my eyes, these rings are all I can see. I'm never alone! The rings will never leave! I've been having nightmares about them, and lately they've been escalating. In the last dream I had, I saw &lt;i&gt;myself&lt;/i&gt; wearing one of them. It sent a chill down my spine. I would NEVER let those rings get to me like that... would I?</Text>
  <Text Key="B2294F2A">Sinking Feeling</Text>
  <Text Key="16C27126">I'm trying to be better about this, so don't judge me! But really, so &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; if I've washed a few dishes in the bathroom sink every now and then? In the end, a sink's a sink. It's not like it's any &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; sanitary than the kitchen sink! Whether or not you believe me, I can assure you that there were &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; good reasons for me to do this. You just wouldn't understand.</Text>
  <Text Key="0EC2F56C">Ripped Pants</Text>
  <Text Key="90743DD8">History class, third period, I was in the front row. I remember it like it was yesterday... My teacher, Ms. Sakamoto, asked each of us to give an impromptu speech on the history of Princess Cordelia. Naturally, I was a bit nervous, but nothing could have prepared me for what happened next. As I stood from my desk, I heard a terrifying &lt;i&gt;RRRRRRRIP&lt;/i&gt; as the seat of my jeans split open in front of everyone! And to top it all off, I was wearing an embarrassing pair of old Voidcritter undies (because yes, it was laundry day!) It was mortifying! I swear I can still hear the cackling of my classmates in my nightmares.</Text>
  <Text Key="AC42DB6A">Toilet Terror</Text>
  <Text Key="F73A1466">One day, when I was a child, I was overcome with a glorious wave of playfulness. I wanted to get into the most raucous mischief I could imagine. So... I set up a prank on the toilet in our house. Admittedly, I didn't find it &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; fun at the beginning. But once I heard the horrified screech of the first prank recipient, I couldn't get enough. I set that prank up on that toilet every day. I became an expert toilet prankster. Whether family or visitors, our toilet was sending streams of water into the faces of everyone who dared to use it. I even pretended to be fooled by it, and was never found out. So... let's keep it that way. I haven't done it in years anyways!</Text>
  <Text Key="9EB92505">Feeling Bleak in Willow Creek</Text>
  <Text Key="35C738BD">You know what, I'm just so &lt;i&gt;tired&lt;/i&gt; of hearing everyone talk about Willow Creek all the time. It's always "Willow Creek this" and "Willow Creek that!" I can't stand it anymore! I &lt;b&gt;hate&lt;/b&gt; Willow Creek! I've spent way too much time there. But to me, even one minute is too long. It's just so... willow-y. And way too creek-y. You know that "grass is greener on the other side" saying? What if the grass in Willow Creek is a little &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; green? Ever think about that?!</Text>
  <Text Key="64798A9C">Crumb-y Friend</Text>
  <Text Key="F52DEE88">Yeah, it's true. I've put plenty of bags of chips back when I've eaten all the whole chips, leaving just the fractured pieces and crumbs for everyone else. I don't care! I only want the full chips! If you want your own full chips from the top of the bag, go get your own bag of chips. I just can't be bothered to care, honestly. But... I wouldn't actually &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; anyone to know I do that on the regular. Don't tell on me!</Text>
  <Text Key="7D8ED977">Kettle Full of Lies</Text>
  <Text Key="EE3D33D7">Growing up, my friend Ann had an electric kettle. It was very cute, and she'd even painted a little panther (her favorite animal) on the side of it! One day, I was struck with the inspiration to add something to the painted panther. So I grabbed a nearby pen and added an extra tooth sticking out of its mouth, between the usual 2 fangs. But the thing is, I didn't know how to draw a panther fang, so it looked more like a human tooth. I was so embarrassed! I pretended not to notice it when her mom brewed us some tea. The next time I was at her house, I felt that familiar strike of inspiration, and added another (once again, &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too human-looking) tooth sticking out of its mouth. This happened again and again, until the day Ann finally noticed, when the panther looked like it was smiling with a mouth full of human teeth. She screamed in horror, wondering if a ghost had done it. I couldn't bear to tell her the truth. We don't speak anymore, but to this day I shudder to think of how she'd react if she knew it was me!</Text>
  <Text Key="95F074BE">Hopscotch Hooligan</Text>
  <Text Key="A752140A">All of the kids in my neighborhood used to play hopscotch together for hours and hours. It got way too competitive! Friendships were forged and destroyed, egos (and sometimes shins) were bruised, and legends were made. One day, I was facing Kenny, the most fearsome hopscotch opponent on the block. I kept a watchful eye on Kenny, and when he looked away for a split second, I fudged my hops a bit, making it a little bit easier for me. Thankfully no one else noticed. I ended up winning, and becoming the new #1 Hopscotcher in our neighborhood. And I was never dethroned. I'm still proud of that title today, no matter what! I don't know what I'd do if anyone found out I was a fraud.</Text>
  <Text Key="8C449159">Grim Jealousy</Text>
  <Text Key="22FAF901">Have you seen him? The Grim Reaper, I mean. He's just so &lt;i&gt;elegant&lt;/i&gt;, isn't he? He's well-dressed, mysterious, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; he's got just enough skeletons in his closet to keep things interesting for eternity. He's got it all! I mean, watching him work can be so magnificent. When he whips out that tablet, it always dazzles me. I would tickle a Cowplant for one fraction of the style and charm Grim possesses. Isn't his aura just so magnetic? It's like it's drawing all of us slowly towards him with every passing minute. Ugh, I wish I was as cool as Grim...</Text>
  <Text Key="E183D120">Liar! Liar! Pants on Fire!</Text>
  <Text Key="CE9F2EDC">Fire is such a powerful thing. It grants us the ability to create delicious foods and interesting inventions. But it also threatens us with the possibility of destruction and demise. And yet, for some reason, I can't help but think its destructive nature is beautiful, in a way. Sometimes when I'm cooking on the stove or the grill, I almost &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt; my culinary creation would catch fire so I can see those beautiful flames once again, just to keep things a little spicy, you know? I mean... I would &lt;b&gt;never&lt;/b&gt; let my pancakes catch fire on purpose! Never ever!</Text>
  <Text Key="CD8B1E7B">Secret Llamas</Text>
  <Text Key="FFAD7D4B">When I was in elementary school, I started to harbor a growing disdain for authority. It would get so tiring following all the rules, all the time! So, in art class, I started only drawing llamas. Llamas ice skating, llamas going shopping, llama firefighters. My art teacher was furious, and told me I had to draw something different from now on. I was livid! How &lt;b&gt;dare&lt;/b&gt; she intrude upon my creative process! So I hid a llama in every subsequent piece of I made. On the surface, it could be a painting of a rainbow. But take a closer look, and the brush strokes reveal a million tiny llamas inside of the rainbow. I even etched a super detailed llama on the bottom of the vase I sculpted during the pottery unit! Thankfully, no one had ever noticed. It's always been my little llama-shaped secret.</Text>
  <Text Key="69B25862">Interstellar Interloper</Text>
  <Text Key="D509069E">When I learned how to walk as a toddler, I had a penchant for walking into trouble. One day, I found a big metal tube in my neighbor's backyard. He was fixing something on it, and didn't notice when I toddled my way through the open door on its side. Of course I'd brought my favorite toy with me, and was happily playing with it while tucked away in a little corner. Well, little did I know, this tube was actually a ROCKET SHIP that my astronaut neighbor was tuning up right before his next trip to space. But when the floor started rumbling beneath me, and the light suddenly changed around me, I managed to hop over to the window, and saw myself surrounded by the stars. It was incredible, but I knew I'd get in &lt;b&gt;huge&lt;/b&gt; trouble if I was found. So I hid in a different little nook, with a nice view of the window, playing with my toy as I watched the stars and planets soar by. When we finally landed, I managed to sneak my way out and waddle home just in time for dinner. Somehow, no one noticed!</Text>
  <Text Key="CD7F125D">Aiding and Abetting</Text>
  <Text Key="E2EFA475">There's someone I see in my neighborhood, he walks by every now and then. The other day, I noticed he carries a different color briefcase every day. This seemed odd to me, like who owns that many briefcases? I let curiosity get the better of me, and followed him at a distance after I saw him walk by the next day. We walked for what felt like hours, until finally he dropped the briefcase on a bench in Oasis Springs. I looked, and didn't see anyone else around. So I snatched the briefcase and ran. When I got home, I opened it to find stacks and stacks of Simoleons! That guy must be a really successful criminal! I panicked, and ran as fast as I could, briefcase in hand. I ended up throwing it into the canal in Willow Creek. If anyone finds out, I could get in trouble, or worse, get on the bad side of a local criminal!</Text>
  <Text Key="91578387">Fruitcake Fumble</Text>
  <Text Key="8DF92CA7">Greeting a new neighbor is &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to make for an exciting day, but for me, it turned out to be one of the most embarrassing days of my life! I mean, you simply &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; bring a fruitcake to welcome a new neighbor... I can't imagine &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; doing it. How else will you help them feel at ease in their new home? But that day, I managed to bake one of the &lt;b&gt;worst&lt;/b&gt; fruitcakes ever made. Listen, in my defense, the sun was in my eyes! So of course I couldn't see that I was measuring out a cup of salt, not sugar! You have to believe me!</Text>
  <Text Key="DF698CCB">Trashy Habit</Text>
  <Text Key="5E3F331B">You're telling me you've never gone over to a neighbor's house to use their trashcan? Taking out the trash can be &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; a hassle sometimes. All I want to do is get rid of all these gross water cups my houseguests left everywhere, or maybe a spoiled grilled cheese once in a while! Sometimes I can't even be bothered to wash those dishes, I just need them gone! So if my trash is full, I'll just pop over to their trashcan real quick and drop all the dishes in. They've never noticed anyways!</Text>
  <Text Key="D13B104E">My Funds Magically Rose, Bud!</Text>
  <Text Key="437C4D1A">Listen, I don't know where those extra Simoleons came from. It felt like it happened in an instant. One day, I checked my account and saw all my funds were normal, as expected. A few hours later, I'd randomly acquired thousands of Simoleons out of nowhere! It must have been an accounting error or something, I swear I didn't steal them! I was so nervous, I panicked and spent it all on a bunch of new furniture to hide the evidence. If anyone finds out, they'll assume I'm a thief!</Text>
  <Text Key="6DC8FAA9">Serial Decliner</Text>
  <Text Key="B287F9D1">Every day, it feels like my phone won't stop ringing with text message after text message from Sims I know wanting to hang out. Somehow there's &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; new places to check out in town, out of town, everywhere! I'd bet if there was another planet that had a cool hangout spot, they'd throw me in the rocket and blast off right now if they could! But I'm just... &lt;i&gt;tired&lt;/i&gt;. Sometimes it's been a long day, and I just want to chill, work on myself, or take a load off. I promise I care about my friends (and minor acquaintances!) But I've got better things to do 90% of the time!</Text>
  <Text Key="64AC3170">Pool of Terror</Text>
  <Text Key="4A6328AC">I have this recurring nightmare about a swimming pool with walls so slippery, it's impossible to climb them to get out of the pool. The only place you can exit the pool is via a single ladder, and it always suddenly disappears as I'm swimming my way towards it, leaving me stranded in the pool. Hours pass, it's getting darker outside, I'm exhausted and hungry. My friends and family come and go, passing me by, yet none of them even seem to notice that I'm stuck, let alone help me out of the pool.\nTerrifying, right? Well, lately the dreams have been so vivid, I've started sleepwalking. The other day I woke up floating in a random pool in my neighborhood, wrapped up in my wet blanket like a burrito! It was humiliating!</Text>
  <Text Key="4FC03A4B">Coffee Con-noisseur</Text>
  <Text Key="DF74749B">It started out innocent, although I'm sure that's what they all say. One morning, while I was waiting for my order at the coffee shop, the barista called out what I &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; was my name. Grabbing the cup, I soon realized I was off by about... 6 letters. But I’d already taken the coffee, made eye contact with the barista, acknowledging confidently that it was mine. When I returned, she remembered me! Soon everyone at that coffee shop knew me by this false name. And I kept going, and I kept taking this person's coffee. That's when things really flew off the rails. I was recognized in public by this new name. Over time it became hard to differentiate this persona from my real life. What's next, a long lost spouse? Kids?! Who knows! Good coffee, though.</Text>
  <Text Key="0790D5F2">Oh Baby, A Challenge!</Text>
  <Text Key="06E478AE">Is it really that crazy to dream of having an expansive family? Listen, I'm not a horrible person to want to have children with different partners. I can name at least 5 other Sims that have done it! I'd raise those kids right and make sure they didn't grow up too fast. I'd have plenty of parental help to go around, too. Sure, juggling multiple relationships in various stages sounds overwhelming. But I’ve never been one to stray from a challenge.</Text>
  <Text Key="9912166D">Now I'm a Bear-liever</Text>
  <Text Key="828ACB85">Those rockets are dangerous, sure, but if you launch up to space in one, and everything lines up just right, you can crest ever-so-slightly above the moon's orbital proximity. Time it correctly, and you can witness the greatest sight known to Sim-kind. MOON BEARS. That’s right! There are terrifying bears on the moon, I’ve seen them myself. What... you don't believe me? Listen, they don't want anyone to know about those galactic quadrupeds! The things I saw when I was up there, it haunts me. But you can’t tell anyone! If this gets out... I can't go back there! &lt;b&gt;They can't take me back there!&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text Key="EBC34E5B">Being Grim</Text>
  <Text Key="EE5A4CAB">Soul reaping is not for the faint of heart. When you've been around as long as I have, you've witnessed a series of fateful events. But even as death, I have lived a full life. I have loved. I have lost. There are times where I have pitied and obliged. And times where I have been downright &lt;i&gt;medieval&lt;/i&gt;. I even owned a cowboy hat once, although I'm not sure where I put it. Unfortunate for you, death's secret is not one I can share. Mere mortals learning of such things before their time would be a grave mistake. One that would haunt you 'till the end of days! But I will leave you with this - rest up before you rest in peace, the afterlife can be quite lively.</Text>

  <Text Key="3F3EA482">To more easily determine which rooms are assigned to which unit, you can toggle Unit Outlines on in Build Mode. The color of each unit's outline can be customized via the Unit Info tab of the Unit Configuration menu. Unit Outlines can also be toggled off if needed!</Text>
  <Text Key="5CAFFD50">By default, units other than the one currently loaded into will be hidden in Build Mode. Units must be unhidden to edit them. To unhide unoccupied units, click the Hide/Unhide button on either the Unit Legend, or on the Unit Configuration panel. You can also opt to hide units as you build. Just keep in mind it must be unhidden to edit it again.\n\nNote that units occupied by other Households will not be editable unless playing as that Household.</Text>
  <Text Key="150FCAF1">Once you've created a unit, you can edit it via the Unit Configuration panel, located under the Venue Info menu. Each unit listed will have two tabs.\n\nThe first tab is Unit Info, where you can rename your units, check value or dimensions of the unit, update the bedroom/bathroom count, hide/unhide the unit, or delete the unit. When converting an owned Residential lot to a &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt; lot, and assigning units for the first time, you can also select which unit belongs to the current active Household by checking the Home Unit box on the appropriate unit section.\n\nThe second tab is Unit Traits and Challenges, which can be customized per unit to create unique living experiences within the same &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="40B75359">Assigning a room to Shared via the block menu designates that room to be available for Households living in any unit. This might serve the purpose of apartment building lobbies, hallways, mail rooms, shared kitchens or bathrooms, or whatever you'd like! Rooms assigned to units not currently lived in by the active Household will be unloaded and inaccessible unless traveled to. Areas that aren't part of selectable rooms, including all outdoor area, is automatically considered Shared space.\n\nWhen creating a &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt; with many units, it's important to create accessible space leading to the entrance of each unit. Whether it's via shared hallways, or perhaps outdoors entrances, it's important for your Sims to be able to reach their unit!</Text>
  <Text Key="C523975D">&lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt; unit assignments are handled by room. To assign a room to a unit, select the room and open the dropdown from the menu. You can assign that room to an existing unit, or create a new unit to assign it to.\n\nIt's important to note that there must be at least one room assigned to the first unit in order to create additional units.</Text>
  <Text Key="4AE5D8E3">To create your own &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt;, simply choose the lot you wish to build on, enter Build Mode, and change its Lot Type to &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt;. This can be done for both unowned lots and lots with Sims already living on them. Note that the Household occupying a Residential lot will automatically become the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; Household upon converting to a &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nYour Sims can also purchase a &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt; via the Phone or the Owned Businesses panel which will automatically convert the lot purchased to a &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt;!\n\nOnce the lot is converted, you're ready to start creating and assigning units!</Text>
  <Text Key="10580AA7">Building Residential Rentals</Text>
  <Text Key="F0BC834A">What if you're a &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; and you don't want a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; in your Rental Unit anymore? You can always &lt;b&gt;Evict&lt;/b&gt; them! There are &lt;b&gt;Just and Unjust Evictions&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nThe distinction between a &lt;b&gt;Just and Unjust Eviction&lt;/b&gt; is important. Just &lt;b&gt;Evictions&lt;/b&gt; carry no repercussions, while Unjust ones will harm the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner's&lt;/b&gt; relationship with the &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt;, lower the Unit Rating, and potentially lead to an &lt;b&gt;Eviction&lt;/b&gt; settlement, costing additional Simoleons for the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt;. An &lt;b&gt;Eviction&lt;/b&gt; is considered Just when a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; has broken their Unit Rules, failed to pay rent, or their Lease Term is up.</Text>
  <Text Key="977BEA83">So how do you Evict a Sim? In Live Mode, you can travel to your Rental Unit or invite your &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; to your lot. After introducing your &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; to the &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt;, there should be a new Social Pie Menu Category called Rental. Within that menu is the interaction for &lt;b&gt;Unjustly Evict&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Justly Evict&lt;/b&gt;. Select the interaction and choose to &lt;b&gt;Evict&lt;/b&gt; them in the following prompt—assuming you still want to.</Text>
  <Text Key="8DD412EB">As a &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt;, you don't have to actually interact with your &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;Evict&lt;/b&gt; them. If you'd like to &lt;b&gt;Evict&lt;/b&gt; them through a menu, while in Live Mode go to the bottom right of the screen to the Owned Businesses Panel. View your &lt;b&gt;Tenant's&lt;/b&gt; Tenant Agreement. In this menu, there is an option to &lt;b&gt;Evict&lt;/b&gt; the &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; Household at the bottom left of the screen. Select this button and follow through.</Text>
  <Text Key="A2EED889">Whether you're a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; or a &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Rental Unit Rules&lt;/b&gt;, Fines, and &lt;b&gt;Evictions&lt;/b&gt; are something to take note of! When playing as a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; you can be Fined or &lt;b&gt;Evicted&lt;/b&gt; if you don't follow the rules or pay rent, and playing as a &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; you can Fine a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; when they break a Rule or &lt;b&gt;Evict&lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; at any time! Read on to learn more.</Text>
  <Text Key="5679210F">Playing as a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; is a little simpler than playing as a&lt;b&gt; Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; when it comes to &lt;b&gt;Eviction&lt;/b&gt;. A &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; will only attempt to &lt;b&gt;Evict&lt;/b&gt; your Household if you break Rental Unit Rules or fail to pay rent on time. The chance of getting &lt;b&gt;Evicted&lt;/b&gt; increases for each Rule that is actively broken.\n\nIf the time does come, however, that your Household is &lt;b&gt;Evicted&lt;/b&gt;, you have a short period of time where you can attempt to convince your &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; to let you stay. Go to the Rental pie menu social category and choose to Plead to Stay or Intimidate to Stay. There's a chance the &lt;b&gt;Eviction&lt;/b&gt; might be revoked with a fine. Depending on your &lt;b&gt;Property Owner's&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Personality Traits&lt;/b&gt;, they may even be more or less likely to show leniency!</Text>
  <Text Key="46A6F470">&lt;b&gt;Property Owners&lt;/b&gt; can collect fines for any active broken rules shown in the Tenant Agreement. When you are notified of a rule break for any of the units you own, you can visit the unit to Prosecute Fine or you can use the mailbox or door to Deliver Fine remotely! If you are a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; Sim, when a rule violation takes place you will be immediately notified. Make sure to invite the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; inside when they arrive at your unit angry! Promptly selecting the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; Sim to Pay Fine will help avoid further consequences. If you believe that certain Unit Rules are unfair, you can also attempt to Negotiate or Discuss a Rule Change with the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="A24A54E8">Enforcing Rules &amp; Eviction</Text>
  <Text Key="F98AC4DC">&lt;i&gt;For Rent&lt;/i&gt; let's you enjoy the flexibility of multi-unit lot living anywhere—whether your story is about a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt;. In this pack, you'll own and manage multiple &lt;b&gt;Residential Rentals&lt;/b&gt; or simply live in a home with neighbors who are closer than ever! From wild &lt;b&gt;Emergency Events&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Snooping&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;Pool Party&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Potluck&lt;/b&gt; events and &lt;b&gt;Evictions&lt;/b&gt; there's bound to be plenty of fun (or drama) for the whole family to experience.</Text>
  <Text Key="0B348DBF">Getting Started</Text>
  <Text Key="BDC4BFD0">Once you have created your units or purchased a Residential Rental lot, you can head into the Owned Businesses Panel to Fill Vacancy for the unoccupied units. Before you move in your &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; households, make sure to set the Lease Length and Rent Per Day of the particular unit. The Max Rent indicates the maximum amount of rent you can charge for the unit. You can also set Unit Rules, which the &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; Household must abide by. Make sure to set Unit Rules and finalize your Rent Per Day before moving in your Tenants, as altering these lease details after they have already moved in, with exceptions to the Grace Period window, will result in an unsatisfied &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; household and lower your Unit Ratings.</Text>
  <Text Key="756B79C3">You can become a &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; by opening the Owned Businesses panel and selecting Buy Residential Rental. You can buy an empty lot in any world to convert the lot type into a Residential Rental. If you wish to sell your Residential Rental lot, simply select Sell Residential Rental which can be done on the Owned Businesses panel or through Manage Worlds. Selling your lot will not move out the existing households, but will immediately replace them with a new &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt;. The Owned Businesses Panel will display all of your owned units as well as your home unit if you are a &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; living in a Residential Rental.</Text>
  <Text Key="6E15E5F2">The Owned Businesses panel shows the daily amount of rent that will sum up to be collected on pay day as well as any additional Unit Taxes that you as a &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; owe. Running a &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt; business has costs and will charge more tax based on the number of units you own. You can open up the Show Bills Information on the phone to see additional details of your bills and taxes.</Text>
  <Text Key="424B409C">Four categories combine to determine the &lt;b&gt;Unit's Rating&lt;/b&gt;, where each category has three levels of quality that range from low to high. The following three categories are directly impacted from Build Mode changes:\n\n• &lt;b&gt;Size&lt;/b&gt; represents the total number of tiles within the unit. Building a larger unit will result in a higher rating.\n\n• &lt;b&gt;Amenities&lt;/b&gt; are determined by the objects placed in the unit and shared spaces. Adding objects from Build Mode, such as beds, toilets, showers/bathtubs, skill/hobby activities, and appliances, will enhance the quality of this category.\n\n• &lt;b&gt;Environment&lt;/b&gt; is calculated based on the number of décor objects with an environment attribute placed in the unit. A well-decorated unit will achieve a higher Unit Rating.</Text>
  <Text Key="4D9C3ACF">&lt;b&gt;Unit Rating&lt;/b&gt; is important to keep track of as a &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt;, as it directly affects the unit's ability to attract high-paying &lt;b&gt;Tenants&lt;/b&gt; and more Sims will be interested in moving into the unit. A highly rated unit not only benefits &lt;b&gt;Property Owners&lt;/b&gt; but also ensures a better quality of life for the &lt;b&gt;Tenants&lt;/b&gt;. You can easily track changes in &lt;b&gt;Unit Rating&lt;/b&gt; for each unit by observing the dynamically changing up and down arrows displayed on the Owned Businesses panel.</Text>
  <Text Key="A6EF056B">&lt;b&gt;Property Owners&lt;/b&gt; can also &lt;b&gt;Evict&lt;/b&gt; Sims either Justly or Unjustly. See the Lessons section on Enforcing Rules &amp; Eviction to learn more.</Text>
  <Text Key="866A6B55">The Maintenance category is directly influenced by Live Mode events that occur in shared spaces and within the unit. Hosting &lt;b&gt;Social Events&lt;/b&gt; with a gold medal reward will positively impact the &lt;b&gt;Unit's Rating&lt;/b&gt;. Resolving &lt;b&gt;Emergency and Maintenance Events&lt;/b&gt;, contributing to &lt;b&gt;Community Events&lt;/b&gt;, interacting positively with your neighbor &lt;b&gt;Tenants&lt;/b&gt;, and maintaining your unit will all boost the Maintenance category.</Text>
  <Text Key="F43ED6E8">After you've set the lease details in the Tenant Agreement, select the arrow button to proceed to the Tenant Applications. In the applications panel, you'll find all the households interested in occupying this unit. Pay close attention to their Beds Wanted count; it's highly recommended to select a household whose preferences match the unit's specifications.\n\nThe &lt;b&gt;Rent Cap&lt;/b&gt; represents the maximum rent amount this household can afford. If the set Rent Per Day exceeds the household's Rent Cap, they won't be eligible for moving in. Look for households with green checkmarks in both fields, indicating that they meet the qualifications for moving in.\n\nOnce you've chosen the &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; household, select the checkmark on the bottom right to immediately move them in!</Text>
  <Text Key="D0FCFEC4">Life as a &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; requires diligence and extra care! But you can manage your business completely remotely by taking advantage of the phone or mailbox. Head over to the mailbox to 'Post Fine' for any of the broken rules, or 'Post Rent Demand' for any overdue rent you need to collect. When an event unfolds you can call an expensive or cheap contractor to resolve the problem for you instead!\n\nIf you desire closer relationships with your &lt;b&gt;Tenants&lt;/b&gt;, visit the unit! You can do this by selecting the 'Travel to Unit' button on the 'Owned Businesses Panel.' This provides an opportunity for regular inspections and maintenance of the units and shared spaces.</Text>
  <Text Key="053E4CB9">Residential Rental Property Ownership</Text>
  <Text Key="904386EB">&lt;b&gt;Maintenance and Emergency Events&lt;/b&gt; can now outbreak in &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt; units! It's important to address these events when they happen, as failing to take action will result in your &lt;b&gt;Unit Rating&lt;/b&gt; to fall. &lt;b&gt;Property Owners&lt;/b&gt; can Call a Contractor over the phone or visit the active unit with the event to solve the problem! &lt;b&gt;Tenants&lt;/b&gt; can also call the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; over during an event, or take initiative by successfully completing one of the goals of the event.\n\nIf you'd like to turn off events, untoggle &lt;b&gt;Rental Unit Events&lt;/b&gt; under Pack Settings in the Options Menu. &lt;b&gt;Maintenance and Emergency Events&lt;/b&gt; can also happen in regular Residential lots with the new &lt;b&gt;Lot Challenge&lt;/b&gt;! Simply turn on &lt;b&gt;Maintenance Troubles&lt;/b&gt; as a &lt;b&gt;Lot Challenge&lt;/b&gt; to encounter active events in regular Residential lots. </Text>
  <Text Key="9F13EAEB">You can explore neighboring &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; units by choosing Visit Unit, accessible from the &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; unit's door. If you wish to play as a different neighbor unit or the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner's&lt;/b&gt; household, select 'Switch Control to this Household'. Neighbor &lt;b&gt;Tenants&lt;/b&gt; often make good use of the amenities and communal objects found in shared spaces. Make the most of these shared spaces to build strong bonds and socialize with your neighbors. Consider hosting &lt;b&gt;Social Events&lt;/b&gt; to further strengthen your community and bring your neighbors closer together!</Text>
  <Text Key="99319430">The &lt;b&gt;Grace Period&lt;/b&gt; is a one-day window after the lease length resets, allowing you to move out, evict, or increase rent without an impact to Unit Rating. If you wish to move your &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; Household out of a unit during &lt;b&gt;Grace Period&lt;/b&gt;, simply select 'Justly Evict' on the Tenant Agreement. You can also change Rent Per Day freely during this time.</Text>
  <Text Key="A5DA725B">Each &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt; unit includes a Tenant Agreement set by the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; that offers comprehensive insights into your lease. To access this agreement as a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt;, simply navigate to the 'Home' category on your Phone or Computer and select &lt;b&gt;Show Tenant Agreement&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nHere's what you'll find in the Tenant Agreement:\n\n1. &lt;b&gt;Rent Per Day&lt;/b&gt;: This figure represents your daily rent amount. Your total rent due is calculated weekly on Pay Day.\n\n2. &lt;b&gt;Lease Length&lt;/b&gt;: This denotes the duration of your lease before the Grace Period becomes active. During this Grace Period, you can move out without facing any consequences.\n\n3. &lt;b&gt;Unit Rules&lt;/b&gt;: All active rules for the unit are listed here, outlining the guidelines you must adhere to. Any infractions and associated fines are also displayed in this section.\n\n4. &lt;b&gt;Unit Rating&lt;/b&gt;: The unit's rating is displayed, impacting the overall quality of your residential experience.</Text>
  <Text Key="93521696">Unit Rules are set by the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; and must be abided by &lt;b&gt;Tenants&lt;/b&gt; living in the unit. Violating any active rules will result in fines that you must pay to the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt;. You can select the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; and Pay Fine for any of the broken rules. Make sure to avoid breaking too many rules, as it could result in an &lt;b&gt;Eviction&lt;/b&gt;!</Text>
  <Text Key="3567A12A">&lt;b&gt;Community Events&lt;/b&gt; are a part of life in &lt;b&gt;Residential Rentals&lt;/b&gt;. Connect with your neighbors through uplifting events like the Pet Adoption Drive or join in to improve your &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt; during Maintenance Day! Keep in mind that negative &lt;b&gt;Community Events&lt;/b&gt; may arise if living conditions deteriorate. You can even suggest hosting certain &lt;b&gt;Community Events&lt;/b&gt; by interacting with your neighbor &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; Sims!</Text>
  <Text Key="784B4812">Pay Day occurs weekly, notifying the &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; Household of the total rent owed to the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt;. When it's time to pay rent, head over to the mailbox or select the &lt;b&gt;Property Owner&lt;/b&gt; Sim, then choose Pay Rent. If needed, you can also try to Negotiate Rent Forgiveness. However, it's crucial to take action on Pay Day because unpaid rent carries consequences that may ultimately result in &lt;b&gt;Eviction&lt;/b&gt;!</Text>
  <Text Key="0E6E1AF0">A household who is living as a &lt;b&gt;Tenant&lt;/b&gt; in a &lt;b&gt;Rental Unit&lt;/b&gt; can also be &lt;b&gt;Evicted&lt;/b&gt;! This will happen when they break rules or are late paying rent. See the Lessons section on Enforcing Rules &amp; Eviction to learn more.</Text>

This &lt;b&gt;Lot Challenge&lt;/b&gt; can be placed on any &lt;b&gt;Residential or Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt; lot in the Traits Panel in Build Mode. Adding this &lt;b&gt;Lot Challenge&lt;/b&gt; will allow &lt;b&gt;Allergenic and Toxic Mold Piles&lt;/b&gt; to spawn when a nearby plumbing object is dirty, there is a puddle on the floor, or trash is overflowing.</Text>
  <Text Key="30B82ED5">The best way to deal with &lt;b&gt;Mold&lt;/b&gt; is by preventing it in the first place. Keep your space and plumbing objects clean! If, however, mold does appear you can deal with it in a handful of ways. Mold can always be cleaned the classic way—each pile at a time. The quickest but most expensive way is with a Mold-B-Gone Bomb. While environmentally friendly, these do cost extra money! For those who enjoy chaotic moments though, you really can't do better than choosing to purge the mold with fire. Good luck!</Text>

  <Text Key="5B30CF1B">Tomarang is comprised of two neighborhoods and the people within have a rich culture and a strong sense of community. Delicious &lt;b&gt;Tomarani Cuisine&lt;/b&gt;, vibrant dances, and games help to bring the neighbors together and are just a few of the things found here. A deep appreciation for local legend, history, and the regions’ natural wonders is a must. Keep an eye out for limited edition &lt;b&gt;Marbles&lt;/b&gt; or brightly colored &lt;b&gt;Tassels&lt;/b&gt; as you venture forth!</Text>
  <Text Key="E05A002E">Morensong is a bustling city center. Sims come together during the day with their families to play games like &lt;b&gt;Hopscotch&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Marbles&lt;/b&gt; in shared spaces. In the evening, many treasures are waiting to be found at the &lt;b&gt;Night Market&lt;/b&gt;—whether it’s community, tasty dishes, or trinkets, Sims are sure to find what they’re looking for. The area is richly adorned with statuary, walkways, and beautiful architecture. Be sure to stop by &lt;b&gt;Tinsu Temple&lt;/b&gt; as well.</Text>
  <Text Key="C4360D9B">Located along the seaside, in the bustling neighborhood of Morensong, the &lt;b&gt;Night Market&lt;/b&gt; boasts a variety of experiences for locals and tourists alike. From 6pm to 2am, the &lt;b&gt;Night Market&lt;/b&gt; illuminates the streets, offering famous &lt;b&gt;Tomarani Cuisine&lt;/b&gt; that will satisfy all. Surround yourself with many enticing dishes to choose from, including vegetarian options, traditional drinks, and delicious desserts. Food is not the only thing that can be found here! Peruse clothing, unique trinkets, and hidden treasures sold by local vendors. No &lt;b&gt;Night Market&lt;/b&gt; would be complete without the freshest fish, so don’t skip out on the &lt;b&gt;Fish Market&lt;/b&gt; where a Sim can purchase the catch of the day!</Text>
  <Text Key="AD6581C2">Life moves a little more slowly on this side of town. Koh Sahpa is a fishing hub for Tomarang and is nestled within the water ways and dense forests. It is home to the &lt;b&gt;Sulea Tiger Sanctuary&lt;/b&gt;, where Sims can donate and support the local tiger population. Visit the Sanctuary for more information about the conservation efforts here or come back in the evening for more... sneaky activities. Enjoy nature by going for a swim or exploring the cavernous depths of &lt;b&gt;Beard Beard Cove&lt;/b&gt;. This is also a great place to &lt;b&gt;release a Sky Lantern&lt;/b&gt; for a &lt;b&gt;Child of the Village&lt;/b&gt; Sim, though that can be done anywhere outdoors.</Text>
  <Text Key="E5B995D7">Welcome to Tomarang</Text>
  <Text Key="F901FC2A">Once your Sim has discovered a &lt;b&gt;Secret&lt;/b&gt; about another Sim, your Sim can Confront them about it, making it known that they learned the &lt;b&gt;Secret&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nOnce they've Confronted the Sim with the &lt;b&gt;Secret&lt;/b&gt;, your Sim has two options. They can either choose the Friendly route and promise to keep the &lt;b&gt;Secret&lt;/b&gt;, or they could choose to be Mean and Blackmail the Sim whose &lt;b&gt;Secret&lt;/b&gt; they learned for sweet Simoleons! Though, the Sim with the &lt;b&gt;Secret&lt;/b&gt; might not be so happy to have to pay for your silence...</Text>
  <Text Key="3191D8E6">Your Sim's neighbors have &lt;b&gt;Secrets&lt;/b&gt; and they're ready to be discovered! There are several ways to discover a Sim's &lt;b&gt;Secrets&lt;/b&gt;. Your Sim can choose to Eavesdrop on a neighbor's door or Eavesdrop on conversations between two other Sims. Additionally, Sims can find &lt;b&gt;Secrets&lt;/b&gt; by sifting through a Sim's belongings such as bookshelves, computers, mailboxes, or trashcans.\n\nFor a more risky means of uncovering a &lt;b&gt;Secret&lt;/b&gt;, your Sim can travel to a neighbor's home and start a Break-In!</Text>
  <Text Key="1137024A">Break-Ins are a special event where your Sim has the opportunity to break into a neighbor's home, starting with getting that pesky front door opened. Once broken in, your Sim has free reign of the house until the owners return. Feel free to make use of the amenities, but you might also want to opt for &lt;b&gt;Snooping&lt;/b&gt; on certain belongings, such as bookshelves, computers, mailboxes, or trashcans. Doing so will allow your Sim to discover &lt;b&gt;Secrets&lt;/b&gt; about Sims that live there! Just make sure to keep an eye on the time remaining before the homeowners return, as they will not be very happy to discover someone breaking into their home!</Text>
  <Text Key="C0563323">&lt;b&gt;Secrets&lt;/b&gt; learned can be viewed on the corresponding Sim's Profile panel. You can view the &lt;b&gt;Secrets&lt;/b&gt; your Sim has learned about them and their current status.</Text>
  <Text Key="199EC27B">Snooping &amp; Neighborhood Secrets</Text>
  <Text Key="10FC0382">&lt;i&gt;For Rent&lt;/i&gt; also comes with two different &lt;b&gt;Radiators&lt;/b&gt; and a &lt;b&gt;Wall-Mounted Air Conditioner Unit&lt;/b&gt;. These objects can be turned on or off and help keep a space nice and tosty or nice and cool.</Text>
  <Text Key="D9DA2135">If you aren't interested in the maintenance or gameplay that comes with the &lt;b&gt;Water Heater&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Solar Water Heater&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;Electrical Fuse Box&lt;/b&gt; then there are decoration-only versions of these objects that you can place down simply for décor. These objects are called &lt;b&gt;Non-Functional Water Heater&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Non-Functional Solar Water Heater&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Non-Functional Electrical Fuse Box&lt;/b&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="A8698108">The &lt;b&gt;Solar Water Heater&lt;/b&gt; is a more hands-off option if you're looking to ensure your water stays warm. It won't ever break and doesn't require maintenance, but this object also will only function when the sun is out and bright. If you don't mind cold showers after the sun goes down, this might be a great option.</Text>
  <Text Key="99D9071F">There are some very fun utility objects in &lt;i&gt;For Rent&lt;/i&gt; that spice up gameplay. One of those is the &lt;b&gt;Water Heater&lt;/b&gt;. So long as there is at least one working &lt;b&gt;Water Heater&lt;/b&gt; on a lot, your Household's water will stay warm. If all &lt;b&gt;Water Heaters&lt;/b&gt; are broken or turned off (due to missing Plumbing or Electric utility), water will be very chilly and uncomfortable. Over time, a &lt;b&gt;Water Heater&lt;/b&gt; will degrade and eventually break. To ensure that never happens, you can always Perform Maintenance on it to keep it in tip-top shape!\n\n&lt;b&gt;Water Heaters&lt;/b&gt; can also be Upgraded to improve their functionality. The Robustify Inner Workings upgrade will ensure your &lt;b&gt;Water Heater&lt;/b&gt; needs less maintenance. While the 5EverWarm Tech upgrade will allow your &lt;b&gt;Water Heater&lt;/b&gt; to function Off-the-Grid without Plumbing or Electric utility (which is normally required for this object to function).</Text>
  <Text Key="6E60DA33">The &lt;b&gt;Electrical Fuse Box&lt;/b&gt; is also a new utility object in &lt;i&gt;For Rent&lt;/i&gt;. When this object is placed and working, electricity will be supplied to the lot or Rental Unit, and (as a nice bonus) it also ensures that the Power Utility spent on keeping electricity going will be more economical. Talk about a savings on Bills! When it isn't working, due to Power being turned off or the &lt;b&gt;Electrical Fuse Box&lt;/b&gt; being broken, the lights will flicker—which is rather concerning for a Sim!\n\nJust like with the &lt;b&gt;Water Heater&lt;/b&gt;, there is an option to Perform Maintenance on this object, which will help keep it in tip-top shape and ensure it doesn't break. If it does though, it can always be repaired. It can also be upgraded with the Robustify Inner Workings upgrade to ensure it breaks less often.</Text>
  <Text Key="3F175549">These objects function on &lt;b&gt;Residential&lt;/b&gt; lots, but they also function on &lt;b&gt;Residential Rental&lt;/b&gt; lots. If placed in a Rental Unit they will function just for that Rental Unit. If placed in a shared space, they will function for all Rental Units on that lot and the shared spaces.</Text>

  <Text Key="1D174E74">And there you have it, now you've become a Property Owner! The up and down arrows on the 'Owned Businesses' panel shows you any Unit Rating changes happening for that unit. Oh, and as a token of appreciation, I've given you the &lt;b&gt;Knowledgeable Leaser&lt;/b&gt; reward trait viewable under the Simology panel! Thanks for learning!</Text>
  <Text Key="4FC34DD3">To get started, let's find a home for your soon-to-be Property Owner Sim! Choose from the available Unoccupied Premade Homes or select an Empty Lot.</Text>

  <Text Key="28797A37">Tenants require their own dedicated home known as &lt;b&gt;Units&lt;/b&gt;, which define their individual living spaces. Additionally, there are communal areas, referred to as &lt;b&gt;Shared&lt;/b&gt; spaces, that tenants from different units can also enjoy. You can designate existing rooms or create new ones! Let me show you how!</Text>
  <Text Key="1E02DC17">Now, let's open up the &lt;b&gt;Owned Businesses&lt;/b&gt; panel to move in Tenants and set the lease details of your unit!</Text>
  <Text Key="5BDA7238">First off, select the &lt;b&gt;Fill Vacancy&lt;/b&gt; button next to the unit you have created!</Text>
  <Text Key="C5F23137">This is where you set the Tenant Agreement details of this unit! The &lt;b&gt;Rent Per Day&lt;/b&gt; should be set to a value smaller than the &lt;b&gt;Max Rent&lt;/b&gt; allowed for this unit. Keep in mind that the &lt;b&gt;Unit Rating&lt;/b&gt; directly impacts the Max Rent, so the higher the Unit Rating, the more you can charge in rent!\n\nAdditionally, you can specify the &lt;b&gt;Lease Length&lt;/b&gt;, which determines the time until the Grace Period begins. The &lt;b&gt;Grace Period&lt;/b&gt; is a one-day window after the lease length ends, allowing you to &lt;b&gt;Justly Evict&lt;/b&gt; tenants from this unit before the lease cycle renews.</Text>
  <Text Key="5708552E">Now, let's set the &lt;b&gt;Unit Rules&lt;/b&gt; for this unit! Any rules you choose here must be followed strictly by the Tenant Household. Violating these rules will result in consequences, including fines that you can collect. Hover over the '&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;' to learn more!</Text>
  <Text Key="730A51BB">Once you’re done setting up the details of the Agreement, click on the arrow button to find a Tenant Household to move into this Unit!</Text>
  <Text Key="4E5692FC">Here is the list of Tenant households interested in this unit! Pay close attention to their &lt;b&gt;Rent Cap&lt;/b&gt;, which indicate the maximum Rent Per Day each Household is willing to pay. Your selected Rent Per Day must not surpass the Household's Rent Cap. Additional information is available over the '&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;' button!</Text>
  <Text Key="0E246972">Assign Rooms to Units</Text>
  <Text Key="9A699432">You must create or have a room block ready for your Sim to live in, including additional ones for your Tenant Households. When you have all room blocks ready, select one to access the Unit Assignment dropdown menu. Now, assign the selected room block as either &lt;b&gt;Shared&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Unit&lt;/b&gt;.
