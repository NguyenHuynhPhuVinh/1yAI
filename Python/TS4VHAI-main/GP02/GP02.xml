  <Text Key="2A68B8AB">We had 8 2x4s. We cut 4 of them into 1/3rds. We threw away 4 of the 1/3rds. We glued the other 8 1/3rds to the remaining 4 2x4s. We then nailed the 8 1/3rds to those 4 2x4s. We then stained the 4 2x4s, and the 8 1/3rds, but before that we sanded them, and then we stained them. We then sat upon our creation. It collapsed. We did it all again, but added 8 brackets to keep the 8 1/3rds from collapsing. It worked. The Simple Ottoman, ready, steady, for you.</Text>
